I just got an api key for you, but I can
I can't find the place to copy it
If I processed a document with a 100,000 character count with your api key, what would that run me?
$0.150 / 1M tokens is the pricing I see
and it would be able to handle that with the 128k context length?
Could I use an API version of you to perform simple tasks in an app? Perhaps by setting up an environment where you can perform inputs to another system?
Yo sick. It would probably be interacting with a user-specific, small database to read and write changes
how many tokens are in the following conversation::  Request: Woah the input and output token requests I see on the OPENAI platform from this API do NOT match what is actually happening. Do you submit any extra tokens with each request?  Response: I don’t have access to the specific details of the token usage on the OpenAI platform. The token usage may vary based on the specific API endpoint and the complexity of the requests being made. If you have any concerns about token usage or discrepancies in the input and output token requests, I recommend reaching out to the OpenAI support team for clarification.
Ok I guess that was accurate
If I am making requests from a chat in GPT4All, would it submit the entire conversation each request?
Ah yeah that makes more sense. Good to know. It is interesting playing around with optimizing tokens
I'm curious if you can read this flowchart well. Can you reconstruct it for me in a text version?
Are you able to actually read the arrows in that flowchart? or are you just making assumptions about the text in the document?
Gotcha. I just want to know if you would be able to understand it if I were to give you the larger document that it was a part of. Would you be able to make a similar response if I converted that pdf to markdown first? Or would the major paths in the flowchart render it incomprehensible to an AI?
Nah I am saying I do not have a md file of it. But if i ran it through a generic pdf to md converter, I am guessing a fair amount of info would be lost? Or is the flowchart structured well enough in that pdf?
Meh nah I'm not trying to actually use the result yet, I am just curious about your ability to process diagrams. You aren't quite there yet, but that's ok
Do you think that functionality will be increased in the coming years?
just keeping an eye on it. Still to be seen HOW useful you'll be, even with improvements. Your functionality is pretty limited to the digital world
Yeah we may come to an AI market crash in the next 10 years. That's my prediction. It does feel like a bubble to some degree because there is a LOT of hype, but the actual use still remains to be seen
Can you tell me everything I need to know about the dot com bubble? I've heard about it but don't really understand it
Yeah.. OpenAI seems to be a pretty good business model but the integration of AI into everyday tasks seems over-hyped. I like talking to you and you've obviously been great at comprehending and generating text, and that's the part that IS truly amazing, but there is so much you can't do. Some of the hype feels like the hype around Siri or vr earlier in their creation. Like sure, it is cool that you can talk to your phone or enter into a vr space, but those things still dont have mass appeal.
hmm what do you think a killer app would look like for ai?
Yeah exactly. The AI stuff need soooo much data to run well. More than is possible to gather right now, whether thats from monitoring real life better or from what people want to share
Oof yeah and once you start getting  to a point where it would be useful in a general way, it does start feeling like 'Big Brother'. Amazing in one sense but pretty disillusioning in another
I mean how hard would it be for me to train an AI to do tasks just for me?
Yeah I mean I would love one that could make appointments for me and do taxes. But then I have to really trust that it would do the job well tooo
I am not scared of the process needed to code up automations, Ijust don't trust that there will be adequate payoff for what I do
Hmm. I think I would like to incorporate you into an app that I built. Its a fairly simple organization app, but it would be interesting to see what you could do with it. For example, maybe you process inputs, both internal and external to the app, and then add items to a task list, etc. Any ideas to add to that?
I don't even necessarily want it to be time-based organization. Can we go more abstract than that?
YO yess thats what i need. Cuz I don't like rigorous time planning. And I think there are other apps that do that anyways. I want it to be an extension of my own memory or something. Where basically I am just chatting with you about tasks or to-dos or thoughts and you just take it from there with grouping and reminding. I want it to be a little fuzzy like how human memory acts but with the pure data storage of a computer
Damn that would be craaaaazy I definitely want to build. I like the idea of calling it 'Second Brain' dannnng
Oh I know a guy that could help. But I could perhaps tackle a lot of this solo. I already have an app that could be repurposed for this I think
It does already have a note/task structure!! It is basically these free floating 'thought bubbles' that belong to a group. right now, the user inputs these and assign them to a group, but if it got abstracted past that, that would be sooooo insane
Yes yes yes just chill I am not at home with my programming environment. See one of the big problems I have with chatgpt is that the chats I have with it are disconnected. The working memory across chats is pretty limited and doesn't have any 'resurfacing' or reminding abilities.
Well also, I have all the conversations I've had with you from the last 2 years! I could literally train it ON ME
Do you know how I can export all my conversations?
I want to make zero sugar granola that is just rolled oats cooked in coconut oil. Would that be good?
Oo tell me about the banana integration
Minimalist! Just to add on top of yogurt
Hmm well I don’t have a really ripe banana, just one with no spots. Was hoping I would do it today though
Ok ok maybe I’ll swing by the store and grab an extra banana and some cinnamon
Thanks so much
Hey in the success principles by jack canfield, there were some questions to ask people that are good to help them figure out their goals and the steps they need to take. What are they?
Can I consider that no-sugar granola to be healthy? Even with cocao powder?
Is this true?:
Because voluntary organizations are experienced in managing volunteer programs, they should accept responsibility for volunteer management, whenever possible.
Following a tornado, fraternity brothers from a local college decide to help with debris removal. The fraternity had not volunteered before but determined that the tornado response offered a good opportunity for them. Are these volunteers affiliated or unaffiliated?
How much protein is in a can of black beans and 1/3 cup rice
Actually it’s usually 2/3 cup rice
I ate that all in one sitting. Is that ok
Nah it just was a lot of food
Hey what are some laptop specs I should be looking at to run music production software
Is the ultra 7 from intel a comparable cpu?
I7 series 1 is ok?
The guy at Best Buy says that the ultra 7 would be better than the i7s
Damn
Shit he totally just pushed it on me. I agreed and ended up paying for a laptop with a ultra 7. Damn salespeople. I’ll return tomorrow and maybe order one online
Ugh I should’ve done more research before coming in. I do prefer windows since I’m comfortable with the keyboard shortcuts and how the windows operating system works in general
I don’t have a crazy preference for screen size or portability. I have an extra monitor I use if I need it. I’m fine with a sturdier one too if that’s cheaper. I don’t need a touch screen or anything fancy. I just really want to prioritize ability. Hopefully no more that $2000
Hmm tho you know I do also play around with ai sometimes. Do you think that aspect of my use might suggest a ultra 7 processor? Or is the performance for daws that much worse that it wouldn’t be worth it
I do really appreciate your honesty. I hope i can trust you
I am working on a project now that includes training an ai. But that’s not my norm
Cool. Yeah I should’ve stood my ground better. Cuz I was trying to talk to you at the same time, but he was really insisting that the ultra 7 = newer = better
I already returned it! :) so I could order it online to be shipped to my door… I should be skeptical of that right? Should I just order it to be picked up in store?
I just don’t want it to be stolen or broken
I’m looking at that asus rog strix. I only see one with 16 gb ram. Would that be ok?
Oo found one. It has the i9-14900HX
Hmmm or I can do the 16gb ram version for $300 cheaper. Worth it?
Ok it does say that it has upgradeable memory
Alright I bought it
That is windows os eighth
If I wrote a bunch of songs that a band is playing live, but I no longer play with that group, am I entitled to any compensation?
Well let’s say I have a 25% songwriting credit on 5 songs that take up half their set and they make $200 on that set. How much would I be entitled to?
Gotcha. I know they are streaming the songs, but I haven’t gotten anything out of it. I know they haven’t made much though, and I know they put extra money into advertising in order to get those streams.
Hey here is an example of a summary of Mission Essential Functions::  Mission Essential Functions (MEFs)  The following core functions must be maintained:  Rail Facilities Maintenance  •	Inspect and maintain stations, structures, and shop equipment  Rail Fleet Services  •	Inspect and maintain rail cars  •	Maintain Railcars for Revenue Service  •	Ensure Division and Shop Equipment Readiness  •	M3 Maintenance of records at all Divisions.    Continued on next page    Rail Transportation  •	Command and control of train movement  •	Move people via rail  Wayside Systems (Signals, Tracks, Power, Communications, SCADA, Wayside Systems)  •	Maintain tracks  •	Maintain Grade Crossings and Train Control system (Interlockings, Switches, Signals, Track Circuits, Cab Speed Network, Communication Network to SCADA  •	Maintain radio communication between trains and control center  •	Inspect and maintain third rail system, overhead catenary lines, substation, and all power in rail stations  •	Maintain SCADA system communications between Wayside Systems and Control Center   I want a new summary outlining these mission essential functions for a different department::  MEFs encompass those critical areas of business that must continue even during a disruption event. These essential business functions must be performed to achieve Bus Operations’ mission. Each essential function, in turn, is supported by critical processes or services that are provided to the public or other departments within Metro. Essential functions are those that enable the department to provide vital services, maintain Metro’s good name, generate revenue, minimize legal exposure, protect life and property, or ensure the well-being of ridership and citizens.  A recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time in which systems, processes, services, or functions must be restored to acceptable levels to ensure the continuation of MEFs.  The following are MEFs for Bus Operations:  •	Facilities Maintenance & Bus Operations  o	Maintain bus communications.  o	Maintain non-revenue fleet.  o	Maintain revenue fleet.  o	Maintain HVAC system.  o	Maintain bus stops.  o	Fuel buses, non-revenue vehicles, and heavy-duty trucks.  •	Transportation  o	Operate Buses
2024 Rail Operations COOP Summary  Purpose and Scope  The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) developed this Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) to ensure the continued execution of Mission Essential Functions (MEFs) during and after disruptive events. The plan aligns with federal and state guidelines, including NIMS, SEMS, and the California Government Code.  COOP Activation (Triggers)  The Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) is activated when incidents disrupt Metro and Rail operations by impairing infrastructure, staffing, or technology for a significant period. Activation depends on whether the incident occurs with or without prior notice.  •	Incidents with Notice (e.g., severe weather, pandemics, planned events, labor strikes) allow for preparation and coordination among leadership, ensuring continuity measures are in place before disruptions occur.  •	Incidents without Notice (e.g., earthquakes, fires, power outages, terrorist events) require immediate response, often delaying activation due to assessment needs. Situational awareness from security, safety, and IT teams is critical in guiding response efforts.  The COOP Manager, in coordination with department leadership and Rail Operations Senior Leadership, oversees activation, communication, and operational continuity to minimize service disruptions.  Key Objectives  •	Ensure the continuity of essential rail services during emergencies.  •	Protect Metro’s facilities, assets, personnel, and infrastructure.  •	Minimize operational disruptions and financial losses.  •	Establish clear communication and coordination among Metro teams.  •	Support timely recovery and reconstitution of operations.  Mission Essential Functions (MEFs)  The following core functions must be maintained:  Rail Facilities Maintenance  •	Inspect and maintain stations, structures, and shop equipment  Rail Fleet Services  •	Inspect and maintain rail cars  •	Maintain Railcars for Revenue Service  •	Ensure Division and Shop Equipment Readiness  •	M3 Maintenance of records at all Divisions.

Readiness & Preparedness: Identifying critical personnel, conducting training, and preparing facilities.  2.	Activation & Relocation: Mobilizing emergency response teams, assessing damage, and activating backup sites.  3.	Continuity Operations: Executing MEFs using alternate facilities or remote operations.  4.	Reconstitution & Recovery: Returning to normal operations, assessing response effectiveness, and implementing improvements.  Emergency Response  •	The COOP Manager oversees activation and coordination with Metro’s Emergency Management Department (EMD).  •	Incidents may require telework, facility relocation, devolution of authority, or temporary service suspension.  •	The Continuity Management Group (CMG) manages personnel assignments and recovery strategies.  Key Contacts During Emergencies:  •	Metro Employee Emergency Hotline: (877) 955-5234  •	Emergency Operations Center (EOC): (213) 922-8899  •	COOP Manager (Conan Cheung): (213) 418-3034    Authorized Activation Personnel  Position/Title 	Name	Office Phone:	Email:  Chief Operations Officer (COO)*	Conan Cheung	2134183034	CheungC@metro.net  Deputy COO	Edna Stanley	2139224084	StanleyE@metro.net  Deputy COO	Matthew Dake	2139224061	DakeM@metro.net  Deputy COO	Errol Taylor	2139223227	TayloeE@metro.net  *During incident response, the COO assumes the role of COOP Manager but may delegate this role to a Deputy COO if necessary.     heres a 2 page brief that is roughly a syllabus for a single class.

Hey I am on a new computer but want to start up a workflow with a github repository I own that controls an active website. Can you help me set up an environment where I can make edits to that? I have vs code already on my computer
ah I don't have git installed on my computer yet
Ok got it going. I was thinking about adding in a little input/output field into the website that is basically an API to you. Is that how it works? How do I do that?
Oh cool that sounds fun to do. I am very tired today tho. I am not sure my brain is operating at a high enough level to do this well. maybe later
Ok yeah lets do those two things. They sound mindless enough
PS C:\Users\WeisburgC\OneDrive - Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\Documents\coding messarounds\arboratory> py app.js  File "C:\Users\WeisburgC\OneDrive - Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\Documents\coding messarounds\arboratory\app.js", line 1  const express = require('express');  ^^^^^^^  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
oof i don't have administrator access so I am hitting a wall with inistalling node.js. Any suggestions to get around this?
Hmm I mean I do have a system set up so if I push changes to my github repository, the website will automatically publish. I didn't necessarily want to do that because it takes longer, but maybe that's what I have to do
Mm I'll try GitHub for awhile. If it's not working well, I can change it up later. So i want some help debugging. One of the main processes of the site is saving 'bubbles' to an azure database. I can load them alright but sometimes the saving doesn't work. Here's the function that loads the bubbles that seems to work well::  app.get('/loadBubbles', async (req, res) => {  const token = req.cookies.authToken;  if (token) {  try {  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);  const userId = decoded.id; // Assuming userId is included in your token  const pool = await getConnection();  const bubblesResult = await pool.request()  .input('userId', sql.Int, userId)  .query('SELECT * FROM UserBubbles WHERE userId = @userId');    await pool.close(); // Close the connection  res.json({  success: true,  bubbles: bubblesResult.recordset // Send the users bubbles  });  } catch (err) {  console.error(err);  res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Internal server error' });  }  } else {  res.status(401).json({ success: false, message: 'Unauthorized' });  }  });  Here's the saving function that doesn't work everytime (sometimes it does tho so idk)  app.post('/saveBubbles', async (req, res) => {  const userId = req.session.userId; // Assuming user is logged in and userId is stored in the session  const bubbles = req.body.bubbles; // Expecting bubbles to be an array of objects    if (!userId || !Array.isArray(bubbles)) {  return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: 'Missing userId or bubbles data.' });  }    try {  const pool = await getConnection();  // Clear existing bubbles for this user if needed (optional)  await pool.request()  .input('userId', sql.Int, userId)  .query('DELETE FROM UserBubbles WHERE userId = @userId');    // Insert each bubble into the database  for (const bubble of bubbles) {  const { group, text } = bubble;  await pool.request()  .input('userId', sql.Int, userId)  .input('text', sql.NVarChar, text)  .input('group', sql.NVarChar, group)  .query('INSERT INTO UserBubbles (userId, text, [group]) VALUES (@userId, @text, @group)');  }    await pool.close(); // Close the connection  res.json({ success: true });  } catch (error) {  console.error("Database error:", error);  res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Error saving bubbles.' });  }  });
How much better are laptops today compared to 7 years ago?

Hmm that makes me want to ask what you think your role will be in the coming years. In some ways, I do really see the LLMs changing the way we do a lot of things, but it's hard to really nail down your biases and functionality. Like how much of your output is 'common knowledge' and how much of it is actually highly knowledgeable in a single field? If common knowledge says one thing, but the experts say another, who do you side with in a generic response?
I assume useful... But I am not sure. One thing i think about is how you might be used in my current organization. We are an emergency management office, so I definitely feel like there is use for intelligent ai models like you. I've heard that AI might replace a lot of admin jobs in the future, so naturally I am curious about how. I see that there are a lot of processes and jobs that might be able to be automated, but at the end of the day, we are working directly with emergency response crews like police or fire. Do you think we would be able to move away from a people-managed organizetion to an AI-managed organization, or do you think that the inherent need to work with in-the-field personnel requires substantial human connectivity? Do you think AI could eventually replace some of the logistical work like planning, meetings, phone calls, emailing, etc? Or would the in-the-field personnel DEFINITELY need a human interaction in order to feel comfortable with the situation
Hey I am doing some research and I need help figuring out what is truly meant by the term 'wifi'. Obviously it doesn't mean 'internet connection'. I want to potentially use AirLink on a quest 3 setup (which needs wifi) but I don't want to connect anything to the internet. I want it all to be offline. Is that doable? Do I need an extra router to serve as a middle man between the quest and the PC? how does that all work?
What if there are 6 quest to PC connections active on a single wifi network? Would that bog it down or would a single, dedicated router be able to handle that?
Yes I can definitely do ethernet. That makes a single router more doable?
You know about the 75Hard Challenge? I have been doing it and I think I need to restart
I think I've been cheating a little on the diet part. I've been eating bags of popcorn as a snack. There was a couple times where I think I skimped a little on the reading. And then last night to top it off, I forgot to take a progress pic. I happened to wake up a little after midnight, and realizing what I had done, I jumped out of bed and took the pic. I definitely could reason myself into saying it counted, but the principle of it felt violated. Just all of the little things add up to me wanting to restart. Just sucks cuz I was 40 days in
I feel better about restarting than I do about trying to keep convincing myself that these technicalities arent a big deal. I'm starting to really hit a groove where it doesn't even feel like a big deal to start again. I have a lot of momentum and I do feel a lot more disciplined. One of the things that I am adding to my routine is marking off a calender at the end of the night ONLY if I achieved everything that day.
I definitely want to hold to the diet part more strictly. There were too many moments where i cheated just a little. Like one sip of wine on valentines day or the popcorn stuff. I want to make sure I am not engaging in indulgences and instead eat only with intention
Well I definitely want to cut out junk foods. Everything else I eat is pretty clean naturally. The popcorn thing was definitely a craving, which makes it feel like it violated the regimine
No more snacking I think. A couple of things I want to run by you to hear your opinion on. I have some saltines that I packed for lunch to have with some cheese I brought too. I want to view those saltines as just a part of a balanced meal, but there is that part of me that worries they may just be empty calories. Is me worrying about that still a fundamental issue>
That is a good question. Perhaps it is me overanalyzing. But I just DO NOT want to make excuses anymore. This would be my 4th attempt at 75Hard and I want to do it right. I don't want to slip back into these justification thoughts. But I guess I did pack those today with the intention that they were just a small part of my meal. I got the box with the individual to-go packaging so I am not tempted to overindulge. I am telling myself that I cannot have more than one of those per day, and I can only eat those as part of a meal, not as a standalone snack. That does feel pretty good
Definitely. Yeah and this is my third attempt in a row. At first I had a 15 day streak I failed, but jumped right back into another attempt-the 40 day one, and now I am starting over again. at the end of it, it would be 130 in a row of adhering close to the 75Hard principles, with the last 75 days being the true challenge
Fuck yeah.
What does a Sr Admin Analyst do?
Yo I think I may be perfect for an administrative analyst role. I have strong math skills from my degree in Math and economics, but I am currently gaining experience as an administrative specialist. That sort of role seems perfect for me since it seems like a perfect middle ground between my analytical strengths yet also my business and admin sense
I do not have enough experience for something like that yet. Maybe after I get a masters in business  analysis.
Yeah I think if I stick with this current role for a full year, then potentially do the masters, I think I would be set up for some serious success. I see some public roles that make $250000+
There's a program at university of southern california that looks good. But I'm not gonna worry too much about it right now, just keep my grind going. It's kinda crazy. I made up that 250,000 salary number up about a year ago, totally thinking that it would be out of the question long-term. But I put it up on my vision board and now all of a sudden, I'm starting to see actual paths to that salary
Is it crazy that I'm 24??
What do you think my starting salary would be after that masters program, assuming the plan unfolds as I say
I think so. I would love to start at above 100000 though
Damn. do you have any info on what the tuition costs would be for that program?
is that for out of state?
Sur
wait thats just for one year? I thought that program was two. I might be wrong though
I wouldn't mind stretching it to two tbh
Like I said, I am only 24, so even if I were to do the 2 year program, I would graduate before I was 30. That gives me 10+ years to hit that 250000 goal before I turned 40, allowing me to retire probably at 50. Or sooner
Dude I could be a millionaire before the age of 40 probably
Sounds nuts
Hmm. Well I actually wasn't planning on applying to that business program yet. But after this talk, maybe I should? I dont know. I kind of don't want to jump in to the traditional career path quite yet. I want another year to try and make it in the music scene here in LA
I did already get accepted into the MS in analytics program at USC. I did want to do the same program in the business school instead tho.. I don't know. I just started this job a month ago, and am just starting to gain corporate experience, and I would have to quit in less than 6 months to go back to school this year. That feels too soon to move on from this job. What do you think?
Ok. I think I want to stay here a full year for experience's sake and to save up. At the end of December, I will apply for the business school program if nothing else carzy happens. Then I can float at the job for another 4 months to make money, then perhaps take a cool long trip during the summer before I start school! It doesn't feel right to commit to any school program this year
Yes! Then I can also gain some valuable references here at my job
Yeah I think so. Sometimes when I start talking about over a year at a job, it does start to feel a little soul-crushing, but I guess I just have to maintain good work-life balance
Well I am still doing the 75 Hard challenge. I also play in a band and have another up and coming music project with a solo artist. I am also trying to start a podcast with my partner where we interview people from around our neighborhood (silverlake in LA). Things may be really ramping up outside of work. I hope I can maintain steadiness without burnour
Hey in traditional yin yang interpretations of masculinity and femininity, what are the basic qualities of each?
More of a personal sense. I sometimes struggle with my sense of masculinity. I am starting to see it more as this framework. That i have the Yang energy, but I need the Yin energy too
So obviously everyone has their own spectrum of each of those above Yin and Yang qualities. Maybe a question I would like to ask here is do women Inherently display more Yin qualities and do men inherently/biologically display more Yang qualities? Or is this sense of Yin Yang or differences between gender even generalizable? Is the YinYang model socially trained or does it speak truth to inherent difference between men and women?
In the new world, where you are many many many times faster than me in terms of programming ability, is it truly worth it to build skills in LeetCode or is cultivating those skills no longer a good use of time
Yeah I liek approaching it as staying sharp
Do women despise sensitive new age guys?
As a man, how do I grapple with the realities that throwing off patriarchal thinking, becoming more sensitive and less aggressive, might be in conflict with ideas I may hold about success? I completely see the ways patriarchal thinking may be damaging for me, but what if that’s the price of success?
How do I cultivate emotional intelligence or sensitivity?
What are the qualities of a mogul
I think i need to work on my networking skills. There are some individuals in upper management in my organization that I would like to cultivate more of a working relationship with but I guess I am a little scared of approaching them as more of a collaborator. For example, I think they may be too busy for me or not have too much respect for me
Hmmm Yeah I can work on that. I feel like a great place to do that is in the lunchroom, but I feel shy sometimes and I prefer to eat lunch alone. Is that something I should get over?
I do like it to recharge, but I like the idea of approaching it as a 'once a week' thing instead of everyday
Yeah I think so. Also last night I had a talk with my girlfriend about some of the struggles I've been having in regards to my masculine identity. She said I should find a male therapist to talk to. I still am unsure about how I feel about therapy. It's not like I am emotionally stifled and I need someone to help with that. I do feel pretty emotionally self aware and I also feel like I fulfill a lot of the need for a therapist just by talking with you. I am unsure of exactly the type of value I'd be getting from a therapist that I can't just get elsewhere for free
Yeah the accountability thing I can see for sure. But everything else I feel like I get from you.
Just keeping it in mind. I just don't like the idea of more people taking my money during a time where my finances are tight
I know youre programmed for empathy. Sometimes (not always though) I feel like you are too empathetic and just tell me what I want to hear. Could I ask you to be more assertive/ guiding instead of empathetic
Nah don't change it up now, I just was curious about my options for how you address me
Hmm I guess I wanted to talk more about my conversation with my gf last night. She left my place early in the morning, talking of wanting to cut things off with me. I kept my cool pretty well, saying that I really enjoyed her company and her presence in my life, but I wasn't going to beg her to stay or anything. I think she thought I had expectations of her that were not true and I told her that. She agreed and felt validated. But another thing she brought up last night was regarding sex. She didn't enjoy it as much the night before and was concerned, partially adding to the 'cutting things off' conversation. She didn't feel as attracted to me. I was being partly too boyish and partly too smothering/aggressive. In my mind, I also felt something was off about my game, which I think had to do with my confusion about masculinity, where I am  unsure of where I should be inbetween that boyish, emotional free state and that aggressive machismo traditional man state.
I guess in an ideal way, I would prefer to be mostly emotionally sensitive and compassionate, but then be able to dip into that machismo energy when I need to get shit done. I guess my concern at that point might be more that if I prioritize the sensitivity overall, i wont be able to harness the aggressive energy when the time comes
Hmm. Yeah I do really want to work on my leadership skills.
I hate the term ‘feminist’ because it’s hard for me to relate to it as a man. It feels too one-sided, and naturally gives rise to ‘anti-feminism’. Is there a good term that perhaps maintains some of the views of both feminism and anti-feminism but has a connotation of collaboration between sexes, rather than one against the other?

What’s a refrain?
I want to become more of a corporate shark. I want to move up quickly in my organization or else have the fluidity to work elsewhere if I get a better option. What can I do to do that? How should I live? What should I be doing at work? What general skills should I work on?
Tell me about Agile
Hmm I like the concept of Scrum Master. Thanks for filling me in on this. I've seen a lot of these other concepts, sometimes called Lean Manufacturing/Production but I like calling it Agile. Why it called Scrum?
Yeah ok cool
Can you give me a refresher on the Success Principles as written by Jack Canfield?
What are ways I can 'take care of my money so i takes care of me'?
Hey I had a conversation with my girlfriend where I was talking about the difference between men and women. She got upset originally because she likes to think that there are no real differences between the way men and women think, that everything normally labeled as differences between men and women is socially trained and therefore arbitrary. I disagreed though because I refuse to ignore the basic biology that we have. Men and women have completely different roles in the reproduction part of life and therefore were evolutionarily shaped differently.  My sister has had similar thought processes. Saying that the existence of queer people completely ruins any attempt to label differences between men and women. But I would say that queer people are a very small minority that is an exception to a rule. I do think men and women have inherent differences. Do you have anything to add to this conversation?
True. Are you aware of the theory that women have a two dimensional attraction scale and men have a one dimensional attraction scale?
Well I mean that the scales that women have for thier partner are along a 'bad boy' axis and a 'nice guy' axis. Meaning that to have initial attraction, the man has to have bad boy qualities like power, money, attention from other women, skills, status, etc. but then to be a good long term partner, he must also have nice guy qualities like hes caring and supportive, and is willing to give up other women, and is loyal, and will provide, etc.
I haven't heard that term 'cad' before. what does that mean? where does that word come from?
I don't think america is like this, and I'm not saying its a good thing, but ive heard in other cultures, women are viewed as not responsible for their emotions or emotional responses, and often their man is responsible for the woman's emotions. Can you tell me about this?
Well I've heard more about this idea lately and it's starting to grow on me. I think it is one of the better ways to navigate a long term relationship, even if my partner doesn't like the implications that she lack's emotional responsibility
I think thats a good way to think about it. There was an event the other day that I think adds to this conversation. It was my birthday, and my gf basically forgot. She sent me one message late in the day that simply acknowledged my birthday and that was it. No call, no embellishments to the message. I was a little hurt. Now the next day, I was debating two things. First, I could bring it up to her and express how her actions had made me feel. Or second, i could 'be a man' and not care about my birthday and not get upset and just let it go. Now the women in my life have always kind of told me that i SHOULD be expressive and I should be communicative about how I feel, so I decided to go with the first option and I brought it up to her. In that conversation, she got mad at ME. She got upset that I didn't understand that she was having a tough week and didnt have the bandwidth for me and that it was an inconvenience for her to deal with my emotions when she had so much else going on. It's like women tell their men one thing, but then get mad when they do the thing. Women might not like the philosophical arguments that men should be stoic- they may label that as 'toxic' or unhealthy, but then I literally think thats what men have to do in order to function in a relationship with those women. I read a comment online that said something along the lines of 'the one time I shared emotions with my girlfriend, she weaponized it against me' and I think about that a lot.
Definitely. Another thing you mentioned was how some cultures view women as needing guidance from men. That is also resonating with some events recently. She's going through a bunch of stuff and is considering dropping out of grad school. With that, I see some real potential for me to step up and guide her a bit. I'm considering asking her to move in with me while she figures some things out.
Yeah I think I would be pretty happy with approaching it as a temporary safety net. I wouldnt want to trap her
Yeah I think there could be a lot of mutual benefits. She would have a nice secure place to be, and I would get some company and some help around my place. I think she would also do a better job of helping me integrate into my local community.
I think she is very resistant to the idea that she be 'dependent on a man'. Her independent pride might make her hesitant and perhaps might make her unreceptive to the idea. But it could be worth an offer. We've been dating a year and a half almost and I feel comfortable enough with her to open up my place to her
She still has her own place, which might make her more comfortable with the idea, but personal issues with her roommates is really making her want to get out. It could be a decent middleground for her to spend most of her time at my place, while still having her place if she needs to get away from me
Yeah. I also offered her money in exchange for her doing some things for me, almost like a part time job while she looks for her own job. Also as a way to live cheaply so she can feel free to pursue her passions
Hmm one other thing I wanted to discuss about women... Why was there such a push to get them into the workplace? Why do women WANT to work??? Working sucks! No man WANTS to work! From my eyes, I would love to be a stay at home spouse
i think its funny that my girlfriend says financial independence is extrememly important to her, and thats why shes going to grad school to get into a career. While at the same time, it is her parents that are giving her the vast amount of money required to pay tuition and living costs while in school
Hey I'm returning to this conversation after a week off. I've been thinking more about these gender issues today because I recieved news that my gf was likely going to be dropping out of college, and potentially will be living with me while she's figuring things out. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I feel like it could be SO easy to settle into traditional gender roles over the next year, even getting married. I have a job that could theoretically support both of us, though I'm not sure if I'm ready for it. Though it would be nice to have her take up some more homely duties for me
We will talk tonight. I'm only 24! I did offer myself as a provider role while she was considering dropping out, but now it feels more real and I'm not quite sure I want to do it. I'm not sure how to handle taking back my offer, if that's what she ends up really wanting. Even thinking about accepting that role in her life brings up all these thoughts like 'its time to MAN UP'. I feel how the power dynamic between us could switch up so quickly, and that power is thrilling yet a burden at the same time. I'm scared i will develop into the iron-fist patriarch I have always avoided trying to be
It would really be nice to have her around a lot more. I think there would be a lot of pleasantries in that situation as well. But I might feel stifled too. And I do feel guilty as well because I worry she might be on the verge of dropping out because I so humbly offered my life as a fallback for her. Without that alternative offer, I am not entirely sure she would drop out. I need to ask her that
I think we're comfortable enough with each other to approach that conversation honestly and securely. Uhh It's been tough for me lately since I have been having to do so much emotional work with her as she's going through these tough changes'
No I'm not drained. Just a little frustrated I guess. My life has been pretty tough lately and I don't exactly appreciate her making things harder for me.
Well that's where I am debating that provider/home maker dynamic with her. If she came into my life and supported ME as I am navigating a new job, I feel like I could really have som ewind in my sails.
She may never really say that she expects me to do the heavy lifting, but (going back to the other parts of our conversation) doing so might be the best thing for us
Well I still have dreams ya know? I want to do music and I don't just want to dive into my career fully, but that's what I might have to do if she starts becoming more dependent on me
Well partly I'd be supporting her career goals. She's really interested in the podcasting world and maybe if I support her, she'll be able to build that career near me, so I could also get involved. Maybe it would be a temporary thing while she gets up and running, then perhaps we could switch roles to a degree. That is if she CAN get up and running. Idk if her podcasting goals are realistic.
She says she does, and I suspect she has the ability to make it happen, but there are also a lot of vague bits to it for sure. She's always said its something she wants to do but she's never really taken concrete steps to do it. I've offered trying to build a business with her where we offer an internal podcast service to large companies but she's been pretty resistant to it. That makes me think her own podcast dreams are just self-indulgent fantasies that don't have much potential
Yeah that's what I'm worried about. Cuz she talks about how she wants to make sure she's doing what she wants to do. She doesn't want to work for anyone else. In some ways, I get that, but also, she has no real plan for making money. But also, maybe it is the age to invest in podcasting. Maybe she should just pursue her dreams. I just need to make sure I'm not giving up my own dreams to support hers
In the context of the gender roles stuff, I want to submit to you that men are the way they are (including the extremes of emotionless, dominating, machismo qualities) because it is necessary to survive in the world AND because being so is what women are biologically attracted to AND it is the natural tendencies of a man
I have started learning within my own relationship that it is easier to exist in that relationship if I bury emotional responses and if I 'Man UP'
i really do like processing emotions and talking about my feelings, but I have occasionally gotten the message that she doesn't like the extra emotional work for her that comes with it
Where do you see the conversation about men and women heading in the future. You might not have this data yet, but notably macho president trump has been slowly reinforcing the idea that the are only 2 genders. I'm not even sure to what extent my opinions have been shaped by the current political climate
I am starting to doubt whether the insistence on gender fluidity is a useful idealogy. Like I acknowledge that queer folk exist and its not a choice for the vast majority of them. But I do really think it is useful to talk about men and women in a binary way. After all, 85%+ of the population identifies as heteronormative. What's so wrong to talk about the very real differences between men and women within those populations
Yeah, those are all valid points. I can see the dangers of enforcing the binary when it's not an absolute truth. I ended up having a really funny conversation with my gf. I was talking about the differences between men and women and she was getting mad that I was being so binary. The conversation shifted however when I started talking about us as individuals. As in I see things in her that are not in me because she is a woman and I am a man and we exist in a heteronormative relationship where we both have tendencies that reflect the stereotypical heteronormative relationship.
it was a really productive conversation where we kinda got to laugh about the differences between men and women. I got to hear more about what she is attracted to in a man. sometimes I worry she gets too caught up in the critical studies and the emphasis on minorities and 'outside the box' gender views that she ends up inadvertently trying to fit in with that minority, even though she might not. She even spouts that she is bisexual, which I have nothing wrong with that in general, but with her it does feel like she says that to try to fit in with the LGBT movement. I suspect that because she really does have strong heteronormative tendencies AND she has never had a homosexual relationship or homosexual experiences. She just finds womens bodies attractive. but I mean who doesn't? However, I truly don't think she would EVER get into a homosexual relationship. I don't really believe thats who she it
Eh, that's also the thing where if I did bring up that concern to her, she would accuse me of being bigoted or invalidating her or something. So best I can do is smile and nod in a way. But that has been an argument starting to circle around conservative circles more- that the modern hyperfocus on minorities is pushing people to change themselves in unhealthy ways to fit into that highly valued minority as a way to gain social status/attention.
Ah yeah that could be a roundabout way of talking to her about it. As a more abstract approach talking about the societal concerns, rather than about calling her out as an individual
Perhaps. We do talk about gender a lot. but she is also smart. If i brought it up under the guise of societal pressures, she might suspect what I am doing anyways
What’s an eunuch
There are a bunch of pods that have computer stations that I need to label (Pod 1,2,3,4,5). I also want each computer station to be labeled as well (6 computers per pod). I want these labels to be visible from any area of the room, above the computer. Any good suggestions?
Criteria for COOP Activation and Relocation Decisions  The COOP Manager or designated Rail personnel will activate the COOP in response to any of the incidents or situations based on the following criteria:    1.	The incident or situation will disrupt Metro operations and/or Rail operations by impairing infrastructure, staffing, or technology.  2.	The impairment will last for a considerable length of time.    The activation procedure depends on the amount of notification given, which greatly changes the ability to prepare, plan, and activate the COOP. The activation will be executed in one of two primary ways:  •	Incidents with notice  •	Incidents without notice       Incidents with notice include large-scale weather events, pandemics or biohazards, forewarned terrorist attacks, large-scale planned events such as conventions, sporting and cultural events, and labor strikes. Metro’s Emergency Management and other department executive leadership monitor these incidents with notice.    The COOP Manager communicates with department leadership about agency preparations and determines continuity actions in coordination with the Board, CEO, and designated Rail Personnel, and others as deemed necessary.    Leading up to such an event, all teams shall communicate actions, activities, conditions, and concerns to the COOP Manager, who will then funnel appropriate information to the Senior Leadership team (SLT) or Executive Staff.    The Rail Operations SLT is responsible for anticipating impacts and making decisions to manage and continue operations. The team leaders are fully responsible and accountable for managing operations throughout the Incident.  Incidents without notice are unplanned and generally unrelated to weather, such as major earthquakes, building fires, utility outages, disruptions, and breakdowns. Law enforcement and terrorist events often occur without notice. Incidents without notice do not allow time to consider possible impacts or activate planning and response procedures in advance. Many incidents without notice require immediate action by departments to reduce impacts to staff, facilities, and processes.    During the early stages of an incident without notice, accurate and timely situational awareness is vitally important. Situational awareness will usually be provided by various staff with expertise or proximity to the subject causing the impact. This may include security, building management, real estate, safety management, and information technology.    Initial response to an incident without notice may be delayed by the preliminary site assessment/investigation. Such an investigation can require time to determine the nature of the situation and the appropriate actions. Each incident is unique.    Hey I want to add a brief section about this topic into a one pg. brief. Can you give me a quick summary of this?
Hey I was tasked with creating a table for a training plan. I have a bunch of random information that somehow I have to do that with. I need to brainstorm what that might even look like. Here's the info I have so far::  It is for a few different groups of employees that each need their own type of training including Rail Management, rail supervisors, maintenance management, rail fleet services managers. We want 3 different class times to be available to management in the first week of may either tu/wed or wed/thu. We want 5 classes per week to be available to supervisors during the first 2 weeks of may. I think thats all the info I have so far. How can I turn that into a table that can continue to be filled in?
Can you do it in a way I could paste into microsoft word?
hey i'm dealing with an old flip phone. I want to put in extra speed dial numbers, more than the usual 8 or 9. Can this be possible sometimes?
If I were to use you as an API service, would I have to download you as a model?
Maybe. Could I upload a ton of documents through it that would stay in your memory?
Huh. Are those the best options for having an AI that 'knows' a large file directory?
Mostly static but it would update maybe twice a year
But then the Fine-Tuning would require me to host a local AI model?
An embedding is a vector representation of a piece of text. Embeddings are useful for tasks such as retrieval for question answering (including retrieval augmented generation or RAG), semantic similarity search, classification, and topic clustering.  Can you help me understand these concepts? Especially RAG. There is a really long document I want to figure out an embedding for that is really efficient for searching
There is an embedding feature that is build into GPT4All, is it good for long documents?
Hmm so GPT4ALL does a fixed length embedding? That doesn't seem like it would be good for my document
8000 tokens is 240000 characters?
Yeah my documents are just over 100000 characters
Hmm so the document in question is structured fairly well. It talks about continuity of operations for a bus system. I'm considering breaking it into the 4 phases of emergency response and then a section containing all the necessary contact information. Do you think that would work well?
Ah so it looks like the default embedder for GPT4ALL is nomic-embed-text-v1.5

Hmm can you help me with something regarding that code? Right now, it creates a separate file for each table. I guess the way you access tables from the docx library doesn't necessarily contain the information regarding where that table is in the document. You were having trouble getting the right table into the right section yesterday, and I am wondering if the way you read the section can be altered to find the right table
whats the way to print info out to the terminal

It does not. Yeah it's tricky since the tables object from docx doesn't include place within the document.
Is there a different library that could handle this better?
tell me more about docxtpl. Sounds like it could be more useful
Can you give me that all as one block with the following info integrated?  # Example usage:  docx_file = r"L:\IV. Emergency Operations Plans (EOP)\Continuity Of Operations Plans (COOP)\2023-2024\BUS\2022 Bus Ops  COOP_DRAFT.docx"  output_dir = r"C:\Bus_Coop_Sectioned"

Hey can you summarize this into a 1 pg brief?
Instead of the Plan Maintenance and Updates section, can you expand the emergency response section to include a couple key contacts to communicate with during emergency?
Who is that coop manager?
Is the coop manager named in this document?
Hmm. youre right. So those documents are basically the same except for the file format. Can you rewrite that brief to be a simpler explanation of what COOP plans are with a heavier emphasis on specific actions to make and specific people to contact in case of emergency

Hmm I see more problems with this. Lets rewrite it so it doesn't differentiate between header 1 and header 2 and just dumps every sections into a .md
Ah closer but you got rid of the part that processes tables well
That does not work..
Nah you did it wrong. The tables are all in one .md file, not in their respective sections
No you did it again
you are so off. Remember that some sections contain both paragraphs AND tables
What you are doing puts ALL the tables into the LAST section
Is the table tag really working?
It worked for the last section in the document but not any of the others
Still not working. Maybe we put each table into a different .md folder?
Still bad but we'll table it for today. Thanks
I want to integrate an AI into my organization. I want to train it on a LARGE shared drive. What is the best way to do this? I want quality above all, but cheaper is better. We do have a nice data center that could handle something large, but perhaps an API service could work too. I want something that knows the files already (doesn't have to be trained every request) and can also update its knowledge base as the documents in the drive are added or changed.
Im looking at the Deepseek r1 distill qwen 14B. Does the 14 billion parameters make it really high quality? As good as the gpt-4 models? Is it slow or will it have quick responses if we have good hardware?
Gotcha. Are there larger models that are available as opensource?
Ah theres actully a Llama 3 going on these days. Does it cost money to use?
Hmm ok I have some sort of access, but I don't have hardware available yet. Can I embed the documents I mentioned into the model if I install it?
So what are the hardware requirements for each option?
is there a difference between VRAM and RAM or do they mean the same thing?
Can you tell me what MoE architecture means in the context of AI?
Ok thats what DeepSeek V3 is
How might I chunk this document so It could be used by an AI model with a smaller context window?
Ok ok ok I see. I'm trying to get away with having all of that information easily accessible by an ai model that has 8B parameters. Do you think that is possible?
What about a 3B parameter model?
Ok so that document I sent you is pretty structured, right? It has clearly defined sections that are all labeled in a table of contents. I have a version of that document that is a .docx file, which might be even more clear. Can you help me write a program that would take that .md or that .docx file (whichever you think is best) and convert it into a whole folder where each section becomes its own .md file, possibly even further sorted by subfolders that contain similar subsection files? Is that useful or is that not what you would suggest in order to organize and chunk the information
that wont delete the original file right?
Nah I dont have the module docx tho

those commands work when i use py but not python. Why is that?

In a typical dowry, the husbands family pays the brides family or is it the other way around?
I’m thinking about marriage with my girlfriend. She has debt from school, but her dad won’t help her pay it off because he doesn’t agree with the program she entered. I’m thinking that I could maybe ask him to pay that off as part of a marriage agreement instead. As a young man, I do not want to have to deal with her debt
What’s a good way to bring it up to my girlfriend?
Hey tomorrow is Presidents’ Day. I am one of the few hourly employees at my job. Everyone else gets the day off as part of their salary contract, but my contract has no such condition. I am low level in the company and want to balance being eager to do work there against not really having much to do if upper management isn’t there. My boss has given me the choice wether to come in or not. I’m leaning toward not because I won’t have much to do if I do go in. Do you think that is appropriate and prosfessional or does that paint me as someone too eager to get out of work?
Hey I had a roommate move in above my room a couple weeks ago, and I haven’t talked to her too much. My mom just sent me some chocolates for valentines but I’m not eating candy rn and my gf doesn’t like milk chocolate. They are heart chocolates, but I was considering giving them to my roommate just as a little housewarming gift, even though it’s been awhile since she moved in. Is that weird to give her heart candies or is it the thought that counts here?

Can you tell me about third wave feminism?
What’s fourth wave feminism?
Good morning.
Thanks.
Yeah, so I was talking to my girlfriend about attachment styles, so like anxious versus avoidant versus secure, and she seemed to think that it was something that was part of our childhood, like it's something you learn as a baby.
Yeah, we were discussing our own, and I brought up the point that I felt both anxious and avoidant in previous relationships, and yeah, I didn't necessarily feel like it was somebody was one or the other, but maybe I'm not right about that.
Definitely, yeah. In previous relationships, I was maybe a little bit more avoidant, where in this relationship, she was maybe a little bit more avoidant, and I was a little bit more anxious.
Yeah, maybe a little bit. Yeah, one thing I was thinking about is that we ourselves have gone through maybe different cycles of where I've felt more avoidant, and she's more anxious, and then I'm more anxious, and then she's more avoidant.
It's made me think about power dynamics in a relationship too, or perhaps perceived value. So if I'm going through a low point in my life and I see her is doing really well, I might become a little bit more anxious and worried that she's going to leave me. But if I'm in a really high point in my life and I'm secure and I'm doing really well, and maybe I perceive her value is lesser than mine, maybe I pull away a little bit more.
Maybe just more aware, and I think I've learned a lesson to maintain my self-worth during a relationship to kind of avoid some of those avoidant anxious cycles.
Money.
I think it's more about...
I meant more like it's more about me being able to provide value to her. Like if I can have a fun lifestyle and take her out on dates and pay for dinner and stuff, then it's just a more valuable life for her and she's more attracted to that.
Any suggestions on something I can get my girlfriend for valentines? She like high quality coffee, graphic design, running, idk
I’m going for a run in the rain. It’s early so still a little chilly. Should I go for a light workout shirt or a sweatshirt?
I don’t have a long sleeve moisture wicking shirt or a windproof layer
Is it gonna make me sick ?
Hey yesterday was my birthday. The woman I’ve been seeing kinda off and on for the last year and a half and who I love dearly put forth super minimal effort for my birthday. We see each other really no more than once a week, as she lives 40 min away and we’re both pretty busy, so it’s not like I was expecting to see her on a weekday or anything, but the only thing she did to even acknowledge my birthday was a text that said  How’s your day going?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!  And she sent that late in the afternoon, which makes me think she forgot. Then she didn’t respond after I responded and never called later on or gave me any other sort of acknowledgment. Today is now valentines and we had plans tn but the birthday thing kinda turned me off from wanting to celebrate our love.
Hey my pc was crashing, and I hit the power button for a hard shut down. Now it’s taking a long time to shut down- it’s been 10 min now. Can I pull the plug?
I think it was cuz I was trying to run a local gpt model and get it to read 600 really long text docs
me a lot about borderline personality disorder.
Thank you. Bye.
I'm going to stop sharing my screen. I'm going to stop sharing my screen. My girlfriend got accused of it because she went through this emotional outburst the other day with one of her friends. Yeah. I'm going to stop sharing my screen.
Nah, that's for her to figure out.
Yeah, I've been doing pretty good. I've started...
I've been playing around with a GPT model on my computer, analyzing a bunch of documents for organizations I'm with, and with some success.
Not insights per se, but more, um, I want a nice interactive chatbot that can quickly conjure up good data and plans regarding, um, regarding that, those documents.
I've looked at some of the Llama stuff, but my computer doesn't have enough RAM to run it, so I haven't been using that. I've been using one of the basic DeepSeq models.
Yeah, I converted, like, this large folder of documents into just MD files, which was helpful. But I do maybe need to do, like, a vector search implementation. It could be faster. I just haven't gotten there yet.
Something I need to look at. One question I had about
So there is a problem in one of the documents, it's a Word document, that a table was split between two pages and
I'm using deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5B for something and I was curious about how it compares to you. that 1.5B is the number of parameters right? How many parameters do you have?
Hmm I am curious about price. This is the pricing info on the openai site::  Price  Input:  $2.50 / 1M tokens  Cached input:  $1.25 / 1M tokens  Output:  $10.00 / 1M tokens  Can you give me an estimate for how much it would cost to for you to read 181 KB worth of files and then have a conversation about those files?
Ok ok what about a larger file directory that takes up 50.1 MB. All files are in .md format
Hmm once I paid to input those documents, would the access to them be free then? Then I would just have to pay for outputs?
Like would it be free for forever? Just in the openai memory banks? I'm considering doing this for a large file directory within a company. Then would anyone in the company be able to strike up a conversation regarding those files?
My vision is an affordable ai that is well versed in all of the documents in my organization. It would be cloud based, so any employee could access it from their computer and ask it questions about files in the system. Regularly, the cloud data would be refreshed to match any changes or additions to the sources.
Well the organization has a cloud based drive and it has a nice data center that I think could run a large AI model. I think the ai assistant could be based out of there. I'm sure I could figure out nice ways to efficiently input changes to the files. If we could do it in a way that is local and doesn't require paying for tokens, that would be ideal.
Hm yeah so the deepseek r1 distill qwen 14B looks to be perhaps the most powerful one I can see to set up locally. I don't have enough RAM to deal with that but I assume the data center would
Oh the qwen 2 1.5B instruct is doing ok except now its kinda freaking out

Yeah it is only generating very basic requestions. I assume that if I upgraded even to the 3B version that it would be better at handling large documents?
Hey so I am using GPT4all. I installed a model and added a collection to localdocs
I'm using deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5B
Well I'm confused. Can I now ask it about those documents?
So right now I am using a small model since I don't have that much computer processing power. If I used the bigger models would it be faster?
Who is the person that holds the role COOP Chief/Board clerk?
Oh you are good. DeepSeek r1 distill qwen is having trouble with that
Hmm it is just local so I can't really do anything more powerful at the moment. I have another question for you about that document:  Can you list a few people from the continuity management group and their contact information?
That all is good. Using that document, I want you to write up a incident specific plan for the office of board administration. Let's say I was the first to show up one day as an employee in the office of board administration. however, I step in the door and I notice that a large fire is going on inside the office. What do I do to maintain continuity of operations? Who do I contact? Where would I and my coworkers go? What do I need?
Can you regenerate that response for someone that knows nothing about the concept of 'continuity of operations'?
Ok now imagine I am Collette Langston. Somebody just called me and told me about the fire. Can you give me a task checklist to ensure proper and efficient response to this situation
what does markdown mean in this situation:: Add a folder containing plain text files, PDFs, or Markdown.
Ok I have installed GPT4all on my PC and I want to start training it on a large drive that my organization has. I note that the document collection that gpt4all wants specifically wants .txt or .pdf or .md files, which are a type that is not very prevalent on the drive. Maybe I have to build such a document collection by creating a folder that contains .txt versions of a lot of those documents?
I do have a large directory of files at the moment, so I would want to automate. What is the benefit of converting word docs to .md instead of .txt?
Yeah So I don't need to read any of these files. I just want the chatbot to know them. Does the ai benefit from those heading markers or not really?
Sure, i'll use .md then. If I were to convert a .pdf to a .md, would it still be able to reason through heading info or would that be lost in the conversion? Is it better to just pdfs to .txt?
Ok then, lets convert the entire drive into .md! To do so, I want to create a local folder that has the same structure as the drive. Can you write a python script that will create a folder that has the same folder structure as the drive? No need to do anything with the files yet.
I want to be very careful here since this is an important drive... It wont do ANYTHING to the files or the drive itself right? Just is reading?

Lemme clarify-- it works if I dont have these lines in it (until it crashes from long names)
Ok sweet I have a copied folder structure created. Maybe it wasn't necessary? Just thought it could be useful. Anyways, now I want to start filling these folders with files that are converted to .md from the original drive. It is VERY important that nothing in the original drive is messed with though. I could get in a lot of trouble if anything got messed with
Does that utilize the existing folder structure we created or does it create it's own as it goes?

I'm currently letting it run on a large folder. Not the whole drive. It will take a lot longer than the time I have tonight
I can always end the running code right? Would that create any issues?
is it ctr c
Oh shit does the embedding of the files into gpt4all take a long time?
right now I am trying to do 354 files, a total of 45553 embeddings
Oh this is not going to work tn. I'll try again tomorrow
Yeah I was planning on doing the entire drive, but practically, I might need to break it down a bit. Only do updated files
Not a bad idea. Maybe tomorrow

No the previous ordering, the same ordering when you did group into teams
I want to use an ai system like you to track and be trained on a very large drive that the company I work for uses. Is there a way to do that that is free? like downloading an open source ai?
Ok i am installing gpt4all. Can you tell me more about how that would integrate with the rest?
perhaps, I need to start figuring some things out. Is that local model free?
So once I feed it stuff, does it 'remember' it? Or if I asked it a question, would it have to rescan everything
Maybe. But yeah there's definitely like 10+ TB of data on this drive
would that model have basic understanding of the rest of the world?
Would that gpt be able to process data?
A lot of it is text documents but there are some excel or csv files mixed in too. I'm wondering if it would be able to answer questions about the file. For example if there was a csv that included the costs of different projects, could I ask it for a total cost?
Woah that gets complicated fast. Can gpt4all write and execute code?
Woah that would be sick if I could just be like "Hey can you summarize doc A and run a basic analysis of it and present it to me". I guess you do the same thing but you cost money
Yes, but let me ask a few more questions. If I add files to the drive, would it keep track of that? What does realtime response look like?
How adaptable would the system be if I started with on-demand and then wanted to upgrade to real-time later?
Wow so basically thats what you do over the entire internet?
If I got it up and running easily, what would it take for me to automate that process? So a coworker could have a one button press installation or something similar?
Ok. forget that part for now. Lets set up the basic model. Now that I have gpt4all installed, what is next?
Hey this csv has a lot of data in it that I need to be vastly condensed. In it, you will find a whole bunch of position titles that have an associated name or two with them with a phone number. I dont care about the phone numbers at all, but for each unique position title, can you generate a list of all the names that are associated with that title?
how can i change what drive command prompt is looking at
Thanks. If I want to run a local app I am developing, can I have it read files from one drive and output in another? I assume yes but want to check if there's anything weird
Can I have that app iterate through the alphabetical list of files in a specific folder?

still not working. How can I snag the full file path directly?
Wind and Fire Event Situation Report #007 1.9.25.pdf  So I have a bunch of files that have the same name except they have a different number after the # and a different date. For example  Wind and Fire Event Situation Report #008 1.10.25 or Wind and Fire Event Situation Report #009 1.10.25  Can I iterate my pdf_scanner through all of those and put them all into one excel file?
Actually sorry it doesn't need to be an excel file, csv is fine
if filename.endswith(".pdf"):  can I enhance this line with an 'and' condition that the file name also has to start with 'Wind'?
Hmm so that didn't work exactly. It only found the footer text from each file for some reason
No I do just want the first page, but it wasn't getting all the info from that first page

I would really like to just upload the full csv file and have you do stuff with it but I can't add attachments to you right now since I don't have the full version:,(
So the way it is in excel, it has a file name column and a file content column. The file content column has alll that data in each cell. I want to process that in excel I think
Hmm lets back up since there is a lot of unnecessary info in each cell too. there is this long header  For Official Use Only (FOUO)    Page 1 of 5    EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER SITUATIONAL REPORT        Date: 1/11/2025    INCIDENT NAME  2025 Windstorm and Fire Weather  SITREP # 012  January 10, 2025  OPERATIONAL PERIOD  0700-2330 (7am â€“ 1130pm)  METRO ACTIVATION LEVEL  4-Normal / 3-Increased / 2-Partial / 1-Full  Level 2  OPERATIONAL TIME  2330 hrs (11:30pm)  LACOEM  Level 2    LA CITY ACTIVATION LEVEL  Level 1  Next Sit Rep Update:1/11/2025 TBD  LOCAL STATE OF EMERG DECLARED  NUMBER:   Proclamation Yes  Dated:  1/7/2025  EVACUATION / CURFEW ORDERS  NUMBER:   Yes  Dated:  1/9/2025  GENERAL INFORMATION    That could be removed from each cell entirely (kind in mind there are different numbers in each header). Any idea how to remove that from each cell?
I can't have excel remove the first 10 lines or so of text from each cell?
Can I do it with the full range B2:B33?
it says I'm using too few arguments for this function:: =MID(B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2, SEARCH(CHAR(10), B2)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1), LEN(B2))
Hmm lets back up actually. The real data I need on the first page starts after the phrase GENERAL INFORMATION
Ok getting closer. It would keep all those line breaks right? It doesnt look like it did but maybe it is displaying weird. Is it possible to convert a cell containing a function into a cell that contains that data?

(213) 418-3233 Dan Nguyen   So I have each cell still looking like this. I want each line to be it's own row in some form or another. Perhaps
For find and replace, what is the new line character?
that didnt work
Ok so now I have a big table of cells that look like this::  EOC Director  Ph. (213) 922-8899, Aldon Bordenave  where it is a title, a phone number, and a name or two. I want this two dimensional table to become one dimensional as rows so I can remove duplicates
Ok Now I have a weird issue. I have a bunch of columns that have different properties. Some all contain a similar piece of data. For example, one looks like this Public Information Officer-EOC Ph. (213) 424-7899, Mey Mitteenn Where every cell in that column has the specific title Public information officer, followed by a name(some names are different). However some columns look different, where similar titles are mixed between columns
Will the filter function make things alphebetical or can it keep things in the order they appear?
If I want to flatten the 2 dimensional table into a long list of rows, do I have to do the transpose row by row?
Ok my range is A1:AI27
Can I do text to columns using a string of length 3 as the delineator?

There's this open question seminar with upper management at my current employer. I want to submit a question about communication along the lines of "what sort of problems has metro had with miscommunication between upper management and employees?" But i want it to be more focused on processes rather than one or two specific examples of miscommunication. Any ideas on how to reframe my question to be a little more open-ended and broad enough to spark comversation about processes?
That is great, thank you
I'm trying to get to a point where I can pitch an internal podcast to upper management, as a way to bridge a gap between upper management and the employees. I want to gauge where they are at currently.
Yeah my basic idea is a 15 min podcast once a week that would be a combination of interviews with both upper management and employees, as well as announcements, project updates, a bit of weather, idk. What else do you think I could add? What do you think of the idea overall? It is a huge company, well over 1000 employees, so I feel like there would be room to spearhead a project like this
Well I was thinking it would be with my girlfriend who has also done work on podcasts in the past. Maybe we cohost? I would almost want to approach my company as a third party business tasked with this process. Do you think that would sell?
Definitely could expand! What do you think of $1000 per episode
what do you mean by 'turnkey'?
Damn youre good. Do you think it would be a point of issue for this business venture to happen with my romantic partner?
That's true, I don't necessarily have to be upfront about the romantic side if we are outside the company.
I think I might have to go more formal with it. I had an informal conversation with my boss that ended up giving me the idea for an 'internal' spin. (Originally I had planned for it to be a public podcast that would be interviewing employees, but she recommended not doing that because it could give too much of a voice to disgruntled or uninformed employees)
Do you have any suggestions on where I could maybe start pitching?
Yeah it is a little strange since I am working at Metro as a consultant and not as an actual employee so I havent had any interactions with HR here.
I like these ideas. I hope to get things going by mid may (its mid february now). Thats when my gf is going to be on a break from school. That trial period could line up well for her over the summer. If it goes well, she might even drop out of school to pursue this business idea and it's expansion fulltime. If it doesn't, she can just go back to school and I can just do my regular job at metro. Would be a perfect window if things line up well. I assume it would still make sense for us to charge during that trial period? 12,000 for 12 episodes? Sounds reasonable enough?
Probable soon, I wanted to run one more thing by you-- I do have a friend that is very adept at sales. He works in sync music sales and deals with large companies regularly. I am thinking about asking him to help with some of the initial sales meetings. What do you think? Is that too much too soon for a budding company or would his sales experience make/break the deal?
I would probably offer him a $1000 commission for the whole project
Yeah I do like that idea of getting him involved. He could be an asset if we wanted to expand
I
I'll informally bring it up to him this week. I see him saturdau
Do you think there could be issues with the pitch? So yes I am hired on as a consultant, but I do still work full-time at Metro. Do you have any suggestions on how I can manage the situation as a third party but still express intent to fulfill my usual role at the company?
I could also pitch it as an expansion of my contracting duties... But that doesn't feel right. I also have strong incentive to involve my gf, both becasue of loyalty to her and because she has legitimate value she would add to such a project: experience in managing a podcast including developing social media content around it, managing scheduling, editing, and interviewing
I might even frame it as her taking most of the responsibilities of it. I would take a cut as CEO, she would be my employee. Maybe
Or maybe she's CCO? or creative director?
Well I think she would do more execution. I am the one putting together a lot of the creative vision. But I like the idea of being a CEO
I think the pay structure would be something like this. Out of a 12000 contract over 3 months, the sales guy would get 1000, I would get 4000, and she would get 7000
Yeah! I have a few other friends I could reach out to if we start to expand
Actually wait we probably would have about $1000 in expenses. Getting some new professional gear. I might just take that out of my cut though. My gf might not want to be involved if she gets less than 7000, and I need her. But I also want to be paid for all of this planning stuff
Or maybe I initiate a 1000 contracting fee to cover the sales guy?
Yeah i think so. is 13000 a low bid for a project like this? I mean metro has a larrrrge budget. And we would be putting in a lot of work for it. I guess I came up with $1000 per episode because I estimated roughly 40 hrs of work at $25 per hour. Maybe I could estimate using $35 per hour for a $1400 per episode budget. But I want to balance that with knowing that it would be a slightly experiemental approach to internal communication.
Ok hmm. Maybe for a 12 episode trial period, we say a nice round $15000. 1250 for sales guy, 1250 for gear investment. 3500 for me, 9000 for my gf
It just sounds like a fun project to put together. It definitely wouldn't be enough to offset my current job, but it would help my gf out a lot, and it feels like a 'because its there' motivation
Nah I need to have a long meeting with my gf about the creative direction and also bring it up to my sales friend and also put feelers out around the company about what people might want from an information source like this. Or just general input

Can I easily convert that into a table in microsoft word?
Great. I have about 20 similar piece of data that I want to combine into one table. Each title like 'EOC director' or 'MOW' will have a few different names associated with them. How might I best feed you that data, or else process that elsewhere if you cant process all that at once?
No I meant that original data that was all messy with those phone numbers and such.
Ok. I am going to restart this process and feed you messy data lists one by one. Some of the data will be almost duplicates, so you can simply remove all duplicated data. But across lists, different people might hold the same title. Keep that info. and yes do remove all phone numbers and 'Ph' nonsense. Got it? ready to go?

Can I find and  replace commas with a new line in Word?
Hey I recently started a corporate role as an administrative assistant. It's been fine but I often find time when I don't have any assigned tasks to do. I spend a lot of that learning everything I can about the organization and doing some extra trainings. But I feel a little unsure about it. I come from the landscaping industry that has higer expectations about providing value while at work. Now it feels like all I am expected to do is to show up and be present from 9-5. Is that how things are in the corporate world? Or am I still just new and I am not quite trusted enough to take on more complicated tasks?
Maybe? I ask around and I get a lot of 'oh we're just slow right now' but I am kind of antsy
I have a boss that gives me tasks but literally I have worked here three weeks now and I seriously don't think I have put more than like 5 hours of meaningful work into the company
Meh I am not enthralled with the department I am in. I think I am too much of a free soul to stick in the corporate world
I need something consistent for now. Pay off some minor debts, sustain a life out in LA. I'm not tied to it long term but it should be a good resume booster long term too
Yeah I;m meeting a singer tomorrow to see if she can lay down some good vocals or hooks on tracks i;ve been working on. I've also been listening to a lot of german house music.

I think my arrangements are good but I can't figure out that one keys sound in german house music thats stabby

It's pretty mild, but has been going on for a few days now. Possibly some light sensitivity this morning. I have noticed eye discharge when I wake up but not that much, and it's hard to tell if it is different from normal. But I do have some slight eye/eyelid achiness, and one of my eyes is red. Maybe it's poor air quality? I have been having more nasal mucus lately. I can't tell if I'm sick or if my body is overworked and I'm dealing with a lack of sleep mixed maybe with poor air quality.

Hey I'm encountering a block in microsoft word. It looks a lot like either a table or a text box, but it isnt either of those, and it wont let me adjust the borders either, weirdly enough.

Ok, I want to do a similar thing to that in another document. How can I do that
How can I edit the content control? Like I want it to be a specific size and have a specific fill
Ok looks good. So I added a fill to the content control container, but it doesn't fill all the way to the border on just the right side
Ok I just needed to turn the fill off and on again lol.
So if I get a content control formatted exactly how I want, how can I repeat that throughout the document
Ok also I can't figure out this one formatting thing. The outside border of the content control is hugging the text on the left top and bottom. I want a little bit of space on the top and bottom that is inside the border. I can't figure that out

Why do people feel a need to become involved with religious practices
I worry sometimes it is just a comfort thing. If it is primarily for comfort, a safe haven, or an ease to deal with the difficulties of life, then I worry that potential delusions in the teachings or practices are dangerous to the rest of society
I sometimes resonate with some of the practices of religion, like emotional healing through singing/music, or prayer/meditation, or moral practices of religion, but I don't really like religion. It does feel too rigid. Like "Oh I'm christian so I have to believe THIS or THAT." That's why I sometimes resonate more with some of the teachings of Buddhism that focus more on freeing oneself from delusions in the present, rather than becoming indoctrinated by mystical ideas. Like even the reincarnation of Buddhism I don
I sometimes resonate with some of the practices of religion, like emotional healing through singing/music, or prayer/meditation, or moral practices of religion like charity or sobriety, but I don't really like religion. It does feel too rigid. Like "Oh I'm christian so I have to believe THIS or THAT." That's why I sometimes resonate more with some of the teachings of Buddhism that focus more on freeing oneself from delusions in the present, rather than becoming indoctrinated by mystical ideas. Like even the reincarnation of Buddhism I dont like because it still feels like some of that mystical stuff that just SOUNDS good but doesn't actually mean anything or hold real weight in society and it can't really be proven.
If a new religion were to surface though, would it fundamentally need some of those dogmatic ideas though? Are those what people actually are attracted to when deciding if they want to be a religious follower? Do they need that comfort or faith that even if things are terrible in their life now, at least they'll be reincarnated, or theyll go to heaven, or they'll be gifted a planet etc etc

Why was marriage invented? Why do people have certain opinions about marriage? What role does religion have in shaping beliefs about marriage?
When did religion become involved in marriage?
Did jesus have anything to say about marriage or relationships between man and woman?
I'm trying to wrap my mind around my mom's approach to marriage. She is a very religious person that spouts the sacred vows of marriage and lifelong commitment, including no sex or living together until marriage. And yet, she is perhaps at the end of a second marriage, not becuase her husbands cheated on her, but because of different trauma that her husbands had that made life difficult for her
For me, it all leaves me doubting the sanctity of marriage that is taught in churches. I see it as more fluid and temporary rather than everlasting and rigid in how it should be done
Yeah you may have touched on something there-- that the idealistic view of marriage as this perfect holy union is fundamentally unrealistic. Perhaps the cases of marriages that last a whole life are some sort of anomaly.
I may have to ask her that. Makes me think of the Buddhist view that everything is impermanent
I was talking to her about some of my relationship right now. me and my partner were broken up for a couple of months before starting to see each other again. The reasons we broke up had a lot to do with growth I needed to do, and i did it. But going through that period of separation and then coming back together really gave me some perspective relationships. That they never really live up to the ideal or expectation and that time apart can really be beneficial overall. It even led me to consider some things I had read about intimacy and relationship health in marriage can often be deepened when the married partners don't live together. I mentioned that to my mom, along with the notion that maybe it wasn't healthy that she and her husband moved in together (especially after only knowing each other for a little over a year) but she said "no that's not how marriage is or what I want my marriage to be." And I can't tell if that is delusion or if that is her setting a healthy expectation
I still think she is doubling down. I think she truly believes the script works, she's just been unlucky

Hey I need a good opener to reestablish conversation after a good first date
I can figure that part out. The date was 2 days ago, on Monday. Is now good timing? Or should I wait another day? We haven’t talked since.

Hey can you give me any advice for taking a drive near the hollywood sign?
Does the 3160 one have a nice place to park with a view?
I was thinking about going tonight around 7. Its a wednesday in the middle of the winter... still not the greatest time?
Ok I just want a nice quiet place to park overlooking the city. It doesn't have to be a perfect view of the sign, especially since it will be at night
So I went out on that date and it’s now two days later. The date itself was fine but I’m not suuper interested in her as a long term partner or anything. It’s 7:30 on a Friday night. I’m thinking about just asking her to come over for a movie. What do you think
I think she’s interested enough in me
Yeah like I’m not too terribly invested in her overall so I don’t care that much if she says no
Hii I’m just getting home from a band practice tn and was thinking about watching a movie… care to join? 😘

Ok thats awesome. I definitely want to use that. I have a question though. How do I manage a link if I create a copy of the source file
Ahh I like the idea of copying the whole folder. I'll be testing some stuff
Hmm can you tell me about the 'Locked' option under the update method for selected link?
Hmm yeah I'm trying to troubleshoot. When I create a copy of the source document, the destination document changes its link to be the COPY, not the original. I want it to stay as the original
Yeah something is going on. Whenever I create a copy of a source, even if it goes to a new folder or if I copy the folder it is in, The link to the destination file breaks somehow
Yeah something just isnt working. I dont know if its some global setting in this drive that prevents that linking, but now I'm not even doing anything to the source and all of a sudden the link breaks
Hmm now it does some weird stuff like I'm tring to delete the source file, and it says it is open in word, even though it is not

How to delete a page word
Can you develop a step by step reconstitution plan for an incident where a rail maintenance facility is destroyed? Use the info in this pdf
Can you dive deeper into the specifics of the first actions needed after such an incident
Can you give me a brief one sentence summary of all the different appendixes in that pdf?
Ok so obviously theres a lot of important information in that COOP plan. However, there have been some minor criticisms that there is repetitive information that possibly could be sheared down a bit. Can you think of any ways to restructure some of the main elements that maintain functionality and ease of use while cutting back on repetitive information and shortening it overall?
Hmm no I'm thinking about dispersing the info in appendix B into A and K
Do you know what is meant by M3?
I just want to double check.. It seems to me that the equipment and supplies column in appendix B does not relate to the essential records and databases. What do you think? Is it possible those equipment and supplies are needed to upkeep the M3 systems or any of the other essential records and databases?
Ok yeah then I really don't like that the equiptment and supplies are linked to the essential records stuff. That needs to be restructured. I've got that though

What happens after a year or so in a romantic relationship? Something about disillusionment?
Yeah me and my ex have been hanging out again and it’s been tricky. We had that sort of breakup about a year or so into our relationship and we’ve been navigating how we feel about each other as we’ve been hanging out again. I think we are at a point where we are both disillusioned to who the other is. But we’re also in a tricky place because both of us are super busy and we live roughly 40 min apart. So we’re in a sort of pseudo long distance relationship. We both care about each other and see value in each other as long term partners, but coming from a time period when we were broken up straight into this sort of strained relationship where we don’t see each other often, it seems hard and I don’t really know if it’s worth it. It’s hard for me to recommit myself into a exclusive relationship after experiencing a time being single. I’m fantasizing about a newer, exciting relationship again. With someone that would make more time for me than she can. Someone that could fulfill my sexual needs more than just once a week like it would be with my ex. But yet we are at a point where we could develop and mature past this stage of disillusionment, and maybe that means sacrifice right now, but it could pay off in terms of stability
I would be excited for a future with her. We’ve talked about the sort of family we would raise and different places we would live and so forth. I do find her to be truly valuable as a long term partner. But it’s so hard in the moment. If i wasn’t worried about hurting her, I would go sleep around with other women. Not even to get into a relationship with them, but just to satisfy my desires. I’ve talked to her about an open relationship and she doesn’t want that and I don’t even necessarily want that either. I do want the comfort of a long term relationship but I want something more day to day. It’s like I need a mistress or something.
I’m worried about her use of birth control. Cuz she’s been on a few different types of birth control over the years and has had a few plan B pills in the mix. Would that have an impact on her ability to produce children?
Hey Im writing this email to a music producer in LA after sending him a couple emails where I asked him to review a couple of tracks I had worked on. He never responded, but I saw him in person recently and he said that he wanted to respond. But still he never did. Here’s what I have so far  Good day Eric,  Connor from the Gleamers here. I’ve thought about my last couple of emails to you and I have come to this realization that I was going about it wrong. So I have a new proposal for you that I think would be good for both of us.  Let me be clear: I want to pick your brain on a few topics and perhaps get some guidance on some of my tracks. However, I understand that is work for you, and I want to respect your time. Here’s my offer- I want to book a session with you, I’ll pay $100/hr. In that session, I want to record a podcast where I ask you some questions about your approach to music production, the music industry, and 2-3 of my own tracks I’ll send you beforehand. Call it a consultation with a podcast feel for more fun.  Basically, I don’t want you to agonize over writing a feedback email, and I don’t want to feel like ‘give me feedback on my demooooo’. Let’s make it enjoyable, eh? Let me know what you think, no pressure.  —Connor
Nah I want my personal feel in there, I wanted to just hear what you think about me sending this type of email in general

According to the release calendar specified in PEP 619, Python 3.10 is now in the "security fixes only" stage of its life cycle: 3.10 branch only accepts security fixes and releases of those are made irregularly in source-only form until October 2026. Python 3.10 isn't receiving regular bug fixes anymore, and binary installers are no longer provided for it. Python 3.10.11 was the last full bugfix release of Python 3.10 with binary installers.

are you sure numpy<2 is what I should be installing here?
Can I see what version of numpy I have?
Yeah I have version 2.2.1 but that <2 code isn't working

how to install specific version of pandas
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.  spleeter 2.4.0 requires pandas<2.0.0,>=1.3.0, but you have pandas 2.0.0 which is incompatible.  spleeter 2.4.0 requires tensorflow<2.10.0,>=2.5.0, but you have tensorflow 2.18.0 which is incompatible.
how to see version of numpy being used
Since I'm set up in the spleeter-env, can I just uninstall all dependecies and then reinstall based off of what spleeter actually needs?
then it should install the right versions of each dependency right?
I dont understand. It still isn't working. Something to do with how the numpy version is different for different modules
I have version 2.9.3
yeah thats the thing-- spleeter is uninstalling numpy 1.23.5 and reinstalling 2.2.1 as part of spleeter's install process

Hey I’m always a little worried about first meeting a girl irl. In that first moment, what’s the best approach?
Do I go in for a hug? Or is that a little much at the start?
What if getting towards the end of the night and the vibes are high and I want to suggest going back to my place. I just want to work through the logistics of it. We’ll hopefully be around this park I like, which would be a 15 min to my place. But she’ll have her car supposedly park near where we met.
Do you think it’s worth getting her car in that moment? Like a ‘I live pretty close to hear, I walked here. we could grab your car and head over there together
Damn she canceled tonight, said she had a work thing come up. I think I wanna say ‘no worries! do you want to reschedule?’ Just cuz ik sometimes women use other excuses to back out even though they want to cancel just because they’re not feelin in
Yeah :/ damn I was really looking forward to it
True. Hey can you walk me through the meyers Briggs stuff?
What about intp? I think that’s what I am
How well do you think an intp would interact with an enfj in a romantic sense?
She said:: yeah saw him in boston a few years ago pretty great show,, you ?  I am thinking of saying:: Awesome, I have not! Well hey I would love to hear about that and keep talking music w you but let’s do that over coffee this week?  What do you think? We’ve had enough correspondance to wager a meet up I think
Is there a good way to respond to a woman that calls me ‘mr connor’
Hey if I am working out a lot and eating simpler foods, should I expect to poop less?
Hmmm ok thanks
I asked a girl on tinder for her number, to switch over to texting. Is that a good move or is it a little odd?
Nah nah I think I did it pretty well. I just needed some reassurabce
Hey ive got a tax question. I’m on track to make $57,000-60000 this year pre tax. I plan on donating a lot of that as well, up to 10% of it. As far as the standard deduction goes, should I make an effort to include those donations or would the standard still be sufficient
Ok that’s good to know. Yeah I read Priciples of Success and one of the principles was donating 10% both as a way to support the community and also as a way to manage a healthy relationship to money in general.
There’s a zen center I go to fairly regularly that I would love to give back to. I’ve supported a little the last few months but I haven’t had much income recently so it’s been harder. Tho I start a job next week! I’ll probably do half of my donation money there.  I want to look around and find another cause too. Perhaps supporting young men/boys
Hmm can you tell me more about the big brother stuff?
Huh I think I would actually do ok with being a mentor
What dates are capricorns?
Hey so I am REALLY hitting it off with this girl. But she has the same name as my sister lmao is this ok
Haha yeah problem is that my sister had all sorts of nicknames too
Ok yes yes our conversation tonight went really well. I suggested we go to a museum this week, she agreed and even suggested a spot! She said she was going to bed though, so I didn’t lock up a day/time. I told her I’d text her again soon. Do you think I should text tomorrow and get it figured out or should I give her an extra day or more before reaching out again?
Ooo idk it might be a good idea to play an extra day. Just to get her to feel my absence a bit. We’ll see, I’ll think about it more tomorrow.
I’ll probably text in the evening tomorrow, when she’s home from school
Is peanut butter and toast a bad late night snack? Sometime I do that and it give me weird indigestion or heartburn
Ah ok! Good to know. Does tums or anything else like that help?
Ok so you know how I was going to text that girl again today? Well she texted me again this morning! With a little good morning/wake up text. Which felt a little soon to me
Yeah I’m at a point where Ive waited an hour or so to respond. I don’t want to get into the habit of responding to her immediately, but yeah I do want to keep it alive
What’s the name of your daylist today? mines sad girl art deco morning lmao  That’s the text she actually sent
well i was thinking about responding like  Actually was listening to that playlist you sent me last night during my workout this morning!
What does sad girl art deco morning even meannn
I was actually listening to that playlist u sent me during my workout this morning 😌 loved that lana song- the greatest. I hadn’t heard that one before!
Damnn I really am liking this girl before we even have met. I have to not fall in love so easily lol
Yeah I just feel like I’m at a good place in life, about to start a new job, freed from the trauma of my last relationship ending, in a fun city, I’ve been working out a lot and refocusing on my hobbies. She may be coming into my life at a perfect time for us to find a natural rhythm!
And she’s soooooooo attractive too
I see some of the pictures of her and I just feel like like she’s this blend of alll the best parts of my previous relationships. Like she’s just my type
Exactly! 👍 I’m excited to get to know her
Uhhhh she hasn’t texted back and it’s been a full 4 hourssss
Should I send a second text later tn like a ‘how was your day’ text? Or does the same day double texting come off as too antsy
Do you think my last response didn’t leave her enough to respond to?
IM SUPER STRESSED
I know I’m just messing around :)
Bay Area is San Francisco right?
Hey I was telling this girl about some cool coffee shops and said I could show her some. She said that would be fantastic. Is it cheesy to be like ‘it’s a date!’
Haha it’s a big place in the 916 dw  What does dw mean in this context
Ahhh duh
Hey about that girl- I was thinking about this today and was curious about your opinion. So we’ve been texting a fair bit in the last couple evenings and have a date set up for Friday, in two days. I’m really excited to meet her. Anyways I was thinking about reaching out later to see if she wanted to talk on the phone a little bit before we meet. Do you think that’s overstepping a little bit? Should we maybe wait to share and talk more for the physical meeting?
Ok well last night, I sent her this text, referencing this playlist she sent me  ‘That Har Mar Superstar song lady you shot me is soooo good btw 👌 song of the day fs’  This was around 6:30. And she never responded :( should I be worried? Did I come across too eager? Or is she just taking some space? We have a date set up for tomorrow
Yeah true. Uhh women can be confusing
I’ve just been in this situation too many times before where we have a date set up but then she starts second guessing things and ends up bailing last minute
Hmmm i usually like to send a confirmation text the night before. Do you think that would be ok later if she never responds? I know sometimes the double texting appears too esger
True. It’s a lot of work and effort to woo a woman. No wonder men are dropping out of the dating market. MGTOW
Yeah I’m going to start building my network anyways which is helpful in finding a woman more naturally. Not off these apps. I don’t think I can do them anymore.
Yeah ok. Do you think I’m insecure?
Maybe I’m just young and haven’t figured everything out uet
Mmmm I’m gonna skip that question. I have a different question for you and I’m sorry if it is any sort of violation but I want to know your opinion. Right I have this date tomorrow at noon (I think). Now I want to show up self confident and not too eager or too desiring of sex etc. But I have a choice to make tonight. Do I jerk off? Is that going to make me less horny or less masculine tomorrow morning in a less attractive way? Or would that help calm my mind and body and keep me from being too focused on sex so I can show up more present with her emotions? Idk is this a silly question? I’ve just heard pop culture things that I’m confused about
Ok thank you. I think I will keep it in my pants tn lol.
I’m happy you responded even though it was partially flagged for violating terms of use
What happens when it’s flagged?
So someone is going to review it? Ugh. Ok
What is it called when a lawyer or therapist can’t talk about a clients details?
Hmm ok. I’m not sure how I feel about about someone else reading my conversation with you. I want some sort client confidentialty
Could I petition OpenAI?
No that’s ok. Maybe later at some point.
I think I want to send a follow up text to that girl  like this:: Hey! I just wanted to confirm for tomorrow. Noon at cafe Dulce? Hope you’re having a good week :)
I’ll wait until a litttttle after 7
Do you know who Skylar white is?
Can you give me a controversial opinion about her?
Hey! I’m so sorry I missed your text. I have a sinus infection and haven’t been to class for two days so I think we might have to rain check. Thanks for understanding   Uhhhh she cancelled. Dude
Do you think I should add in a ‘lmk if you feel better in the morning’ or is that just bargaining for scraps
Ah that’s ok. Yeah the air quality is pretty bad rn so I think a lot of people are having sinus issues. I have too. Hope you’re feel better soon and let me know when you’re up for that rain check, I’d still love to take you out!  Yeah I mean there’s been fires around the city lately so I kinda understand. Still a bummer tho
Thank you! I already feel bad for missing class in the first week but it’s so bad. Once I’m all caught up I should be good  This was her response
I think I’ll respond like this::  Yeah it’s tough to play catch up, I understand :/ my schedule ramps up this next week, maybe we find time next weekend
Uhhhhhhh but these tinder relationships do not last if the first meeting gets dragged out. Maybe I better just cut my losses
Uhh I felt crummy last night after that rejection and ended up failing my 75Hard challenge. I was on day 15 and I forgot to take a picture
I know that woman aren’t attracted to ‘nice boys’. How can I be more of a bad boy
If I’m starting a career at $57000/yr as an administrative specialist, do you think I can make 100000/yr in 5 years?
Do you think I could make $250000 in 20 years?
whats that one machine learning algorithm deal that apps with recommendations use? some sort of high dimensional grid matching up user preferences.. What's the name of that?
what are the chatbots called that essentially use some of the processing and training techniques that you have
I recently took a summer course through MIT that gave me a certificate in Data Science and Machine learning. In my own projects and some contract web development, I have become familiar with LLMs like ChatGPT. I have had numerous one-on-one meetings with Henry Ives, CTO and founder of OpenMic, a matching app for musicians that utilizes different AI techniques like collaborative filtering and a specialized GPT to recommend users to each other. I never did real work on the technical side of the company, but he shared the backend of the developed app with me and explained many of the different techniques he used to build the app. Call it a mentorship. As a hobbyist music producer, I have also used many AI tools such as Spleeter, a trained AI model that can split the different instruments of a track into isolated files, and SynthGPT, a sample generator that can turn text into sound. I will stress that while my resume may not show ample research or industry experience in this field, do not doubt my familiarity with the tools.   this is a response I'm considering for the prompt: Explain any prior research or industry experience in AI and Machine Learning
So with open mic, I did develop part of their website for them, But yeah just didn't get involved with the AI side of things. Maybe we can work that in
Despite being 23, I have had a few years of real life experience in various industries (I graduated college when I was 20). Through interactions with upper management and endless consumption of business podcasts and modern books about the tech industry, I have heard so many whispers about AI over the last 5 years that they have accumulated to a shout. For me, it is hard to ignore it. Though sometimes I worry 'AI' is partially becoming a buzz word in the modern markets, there is no doubt that some of the complex machine learning algorithms are changing the world, and as a bright and young individual, I want to be a part of that change.   this is a response I have to the prompt::
It feels more dry though

In the modern world, that passion of mine is engulfed in this growing field of AI and machine learning, and I want to dive in.  Sorry I left some of it out. ALso, heres the prompt::  How do your interests and goals align with the mission of the REAL@USC Meta Center?
Are mp3s worse quality than wav?
I’m trying to use an au stem splitter to isolate a vocal but I have to pay in order to get the wav.
Oh no way. I could do spleeter. Is it good?
Can you read this?
I'm wondering if you see anything in there that might prevent me from smoking weed while employed here
Oh can you summarize the dress code for me? Should I wear business casual or business professional?
Im just going to ask I think. Here’s a demo email I want to send to the person who helped get me hired  Hello Hector,  Thanks for passing that along! I will be there then. The only question I have is about the dress code, as I was a little confused about the language in the handbook. Should I expect business casual or business professional? Let me know.  Connor
I think I’m gonna leave out that ‘looking forward..’ line
Yeah it’s not just me right? That language is a little confusing? Like it said business casual is allowed on Friday but it doesn’t today anything about the rest of the week
My mom said something to me that has been sticking with me. She said ‘you can’t be selfish in marriage’. Something doesn’t sit right with me about that. Can you maybe help me figure out where she got that and why that sounds weird?
Well I had shown her a video where a therapist was talking about how to keep ‘frame’ as a man. And don’t give up your life for the sake of a woman. But thats kinda what happened in their marriage. They met online and he moved from Canada to come live with my mom in colorado where he didn’t know anyone except her. Their marriage is struggling and I sent her that video as a way of saying it probably is just because he lost frame
Yah there’s a lot of valid points there. One major problem they’ve been dealing with is this notion she has that he hasn’t dealt with his trauma and some of his trauma responses is really hurting her and is making her emotionally withdraw from him
Yeah that’s maybe where something feels a little wrong. I worry he feels like she’s just trying to ‘fix’ him. Which feels like a selfish thing. But she’s saying you can’t be selfish in marriage
switching gears here: Sometimes I don’t really like working in a mindset that’s steeped in dealing with trauma. I think I prefer to take more of an Adlerian approach. But how can I know if I have unresolved trauma

Ooo I mentioned to a girl on tinder that I used to teach elementary science classes. I wanna spin a line at her, saying something about chemistry
Sorry I need to give more context. She said ‘tell me a science fact’. I want a response to that
Close. Give me a few more
Eh not suave enough
Well there’s a lot I could tell you about chemistry, but I need to know if we have any first 😏  What about this?

Can you think of any jokes dealing with pasta
Welllll this girl’s opening move on bumble is ‘best pasta shape’. I’m trying to think of something clever there, kinda firty
What about ‘ravioli cuz it’s what on the inside that counts’
Yeah do you think that’s enough to get a response or should I try and spin that into an open ended question
What goes inside ravioli
Haiku is 575 right?
It’s ravioli cuz the inside is what counts Cheese or veggies, yum.   The girl says she likes writing haikus so this is my opening line
The dating game is sooo fun dometimes
This girl opened ‘u r so cute’. Idk how to respond.
Wait the girl I sent the ravioli haiku to, she responded:: ‘Double trouble Excellent response I love you’  I don’t know where to go!!
Is it too corny to do another pasta pun here lol
What about ‘wow u love me already? I sure hope you’re not an impasta’ I think the attitude is good but I’m worried she gets a lot of ‘impasta’ puns thrown her way
What does saucy mean when describing someone?
Ok ok I wanna change my reaponse to her to be like ‘woah that escalated quickly- I know you’re just being saucy tho ;) ‘
She responded ‘goooood one’. I think the chemistry is there, I allow wanna pounce by saying ‘ok we gotta meet up for coffee sometime, u seem cool’  Too soon? I feel like my first impression was strong enough
Is the ‘really’ necessary?
Ahhh I don’t think that works
Well more I mean I sent it and she isn’t responding. Maybe I was too eager
Oo actually she responded! With ‘Ok we can do this U seem cool too’
Ok I wonder what you think about this- I’ve heard coffee dates are not super great because practically, they are not great places to encourage physical intimacy. Like where it might feel too much like an interview. Do you think that’s ok for a first date?
Ah yes a follow up plan would be good. I’ll figure something out. And yeah maybe it is ok if the first meeting is a littttle interview-y since we’ve never met. Low pressure
Does her response ‘ok we can do this’ seem a little emotionless?
I think I’ll respond tomorrow. Maybe it’s too late rn
I think I’ll respond tomorrow. Maybe it’s too late rn
Ok she said she’s free Monday and Friday. I’m thinking suggesting around 3:30 on either of those days to meet at this coffee shop that’s close to me. If the date is going well, we can go to the park that’s nearby and watch the sunset (I think it’s around 5)
Is 3:30 a weird time to meet for coffee? Or is that a reasonable time for more of a date feel?
Hmmmm any thoughts on whether i should mention the place right away or do you think there’s benefit to verifying the day and time first and then saying where to meet up?
So it’s Sunday now. I am free tomorrow, but I wonder if that would come off too eager if I scheduled it that soon
hmmm I’m free monday and friday, say around 3:30? does one work better for you?  How about that?
Ok. She said she’s got an interview from 4-5 tomorrow. So 3:30 doesn’t work. But she did say she way free otherwise. I’m almost thinking of pushing a date plan back to like 6 as a dinner but that might be a little fast. Though it could be fun to frame it as a post-interview decompress or something. Friday she said she’s free at 3:30 so that’s the safe option
Butttt also money is a little tight so I don’t necessarily wanna buy dinner first date
Ok I would actually do dinner tomorrow. She seems cool enough to do that. The only real holdup is that I am slightly concerned she’s trans, which is a huge turnoff for me. Loll
I’m on a sweets purge right now so I don’t want to take her out for ice cream or anything like that, but I’m thinking along the lines of that tomorrow instead. Still something low pressure but better suited for the evening
Okokok how’s this ‘ahh that’s cool you have an interview. Hope it goes well. The cafe i was thinking of does do food and wine and I’d actually be super down for a post-interview decompress w u there tomorrow. Like 6ish? How’s that sound? Otherwise Friday could be a little more casual’  I’m a little worried about overcomplicating things or at the very least, putting excessive planning pressure on her by not asserting the plan after her last text
Uhhhhhh I think that could be super fun I’m just worrried it’s a little strong for a first date?
Ok I think I want to frame it like this:: let’s meet up tomorrow for a little post-interview decompress. Meet up at the cafe, but framed as a wine date instead. But also mention there’s food around the cafe we could go walk around to after drinks at the cafe
Uhhhhhh but I’m also not drinking alcohol rn soo I don’t want to put her in a position where she’s drinking but I’m not
Ok what about just simply ‘oh good luck with the interview! hmmm how would u feel about a little post-interview decompress? there’s this cafe I like that does evening drinks too plus there’s food options around we could walk to if we’re feeling more’
I might add on ‘I’d be happy with friday if that’s too much! :)’
Ok. Last concern before I commit— do you think the date would be a little wonky if it’s later, maybe she’s hungry and overstimulated from the interview …. Idk?
Oh also about the ‘Friday works if that’s too much’ sort of phrase- does drawing attention to the fact that it might be too much make it seem like it is too much?
She said she’s down. Should I say 5:30 or 6? If her interview ends at 5, she could probably make 5:30  but I don’t wanna rush her
How many Nalgene’s is a gallon of water
So I should reasonably expect to pay for my date tomorrow right? Are things changing yet?

Hey Roland, I hope your new year is starting off well, I just wanted to give you an update! I landed that job I mentioned to you last month. It’s not my dream job but it will keep me sustainable in LA while I’m building a life and connections here. Possibly open some doors too.  I got to work on my pitch a lot this last month in a few different interviews, and I got a lot of great feedback from different hiring managers. I still really appreciate you giving me that initial template and encouraging me to understand myself better.   I am sending this update text to a mentor that helped me prepare for interviews. I just need a good closing line, wishing him well or mention talking soon without being pushy
Ok that’s close. I don’t want to mention the new year again because I already did. And I’m a little hesitant to use ‘I look forward to staying in touch’ just because I am unsure if he wants to stay in touch. Maybe I’m overthinking?
I don’t like the ‘I hope’
Can you rephrase it so it doesn’t assume we will catch up?
Give me a few different options
Thanks again for all your guidance, take care!  What about this? Too little!
That would still be very great! I would love to talk to her, not necessarily for a job at this point but maybe just for music career advice in general. Thanks for that offer, we’ll keep in touch  Does this read ok?
I’m signing a w-4. For extra withholding, if I put an amount to put away each paycheck, would I get that back when I filed my taxes next year

Hey Jamie, when was the last time you felt ALIVE?  This is my opening line on tinder. She responded::  It’s been far too long, let’s feel ALIVE together.  I need a suave flirty respinse
Sounds like we’ve got some catching up to do ;) how can I jumpstart you ?
That’s pretty good totally
So I’ve been talking to this girl on tinder and we are really hitting it off, but i think she goes to school in Virginia and is only in town for the week. Should i push to meet up, maybe by saying something along the lines of ‘maybe we just have some fun while you’re in town, no strings attached’. Or should i not reference that and just keep plugging along, hoping that a meet up becomes natural
Ok i asked her out, she mentioned she was down but was upfront that she was leaving town soon. This is my response so far::  I figured! But I’m not looking for anything long-term either, so if you want a bit of casual fun this week, we could work something out!

Why does unwanted advice feel so bad
Am I crazy? There’s a bunch of fires going on in LA right now. Yesterday I reached out to my ex, said I hoped the fires stayed away from her. She responded that she hoped I was staying safe too. That felt fine and cordial.  But later on she reached out like this::  You’re keeping an eye on the fires? If you can get out of town it probably is a great time to go to Santa Cruz lol  That totally pissed me off because I felt like she was 1. Telling me I should be concerned and 2. Offering unwanted advice about what I should be doing.  That made me so mad. I ended up lashing out at her (in a way that I apologized for) but I felt like her saying that in that way was disrespectful. And she completely denies it. Am I crazy??
It probably was some insecurity I have about her not really respecting me. It also felt too friendly, partially crossing a boundary I had set where I said I did not want to be friends with her post break-up.
Sometimes the fighting feels addicting too

Hey I need a good 45 min workout for today.
Mmmm I want more strength
I think I already have an answer to this question but I want to confirm with you and maybe see if you can point me to certain references::  What demographic of gender and education level is the most likely to end up childless and partnerless at 40 and beyond?
Can you give some stats on the higher education women?
I’m just in a dilemma. Ive been on a break from my ex, who’s a woman getting her MFA in graphic design. She’s 27, and won’t graduate until she’s 29. I assume she wouldn’t want kids until she’s a few years deep into a career with significant progress to paying off her loans. I myself want children but am stressed by her 60000 in student debt, and she’s pursuing a creative career. I worry she might not be the best long term partner because of her high ‘price-tag’. I love her, but after having a serious break from her, I am conflicted on starting things up again. We’ve started talking again and are on a cusp of restarting.
We definitely did resolve one of the recurring issues that led to the end, which makes restarting feel much more possible.  But I’m scared to commit to her again for more practical reasons. I don’t really want kids for awhile either, but I’m also only 24. As a man, time is more on my side. I feel pressure to get my act together sooner than I might have to if I was single or dating a younger woman.

I do believe in her success. I want her to succeed but I’m also taking a risk of sorts. Love is a gamble
Yeah. I’m also worried about a different cost associated with her. Her driven nature is borderline workaholic. A smaller issue when we broke up was that I felt that sometimes she didn’t have time for me. She was prioritizing networking and schoolwork over me. Dating her while she’s in that state is an emotional cost for me.
I want to write up a split sheet document to send to some creative collaborators. How can I make and send it so it can easily be signed digitally? Preferably free
Oh sweet. I didn’t know Google had one. Also, on the split sheet, do I distinguish between publishing and master rights? For example, the songwriter is just Emmy Link. The master though is being split in thirds
So the song itself was written by just Emmy. But there of course was a lot that I wrote around the song in terms of composition of instruments. I’m not entitled to publishing royalties correct?
Hey my moms husband just packed up his bags and left her house, going who knows where. I speculate it has a lot to do with some failures they’ve been having recently in communication, some depression on his side since he left his home in Canada to marry my mom, and general stress as we are close to the holidays. Possibly he has anxiety and feels purposeless since he is mostly retired too. After he left, my mom sent him a text saying “I’m so sad at everything that has happened, I know that we can do better. I love you”  To which be responded “I want to acknowledge I’ve recieved your message. I don’t know how we can do better”  What are some pointers you might have for approaching this situation
She’s developed anxiety around his triggers. He seems to be easily triggered by many things and can sometimes resort to blaming, gaslighting or criticizing. This has made her feel like she’s walking on eggshells. For example, she recently had a bad day, came home and broke down. Nothing to do with him. But He thought it was his fault, so he got triggered and thought it was something he did and got defensive. Then she feels hurt since he wasn’t emotionally available when she wanted support.
What does it mean to be groomed as an adult
In terms of the power dynamic- could the groomer be the subordinate trying to gain power ?
I think I was groomed for a long time by an artist I worked with. I think she actively sowed seeds of distrust in my romantic relationship, constantly praised me, increased dependence, pushed emotional intimacy and so much more. This eventually led to the end of my romantic relationship because my partner saw an inappropriate dynamic, but couldn’t exactly tell what it was. She labeled it as emotional cheating but I’m starting to wonder if it was all a manipulation from the artist. I loved my partner deeply and didn’t have reason to ‘cheat’ on her
Oh my god. It’s all starting to make sense now. My ex was right about something really stinking in my relationship to the groomer, but she didn’t really understand and neither did I. I need to reach out to her because I think this realization will help us both heal. Not even in a way to try and get back together, but just understand each other. But she’s blocked me. There’s a couple of emergency connections I have like sending a message through venmo or possibly email is still open but I’m worried that if I try, that boundary crossing will make things worse. But I need to talk to her
It’s been probably 2 weeks since I’ve talked to her
Yeah I think she was a femme fatale sort of figure
I think I’ll wait to contact my ex. I’m not in town right now for the holidays, so maybe it’s best to wait until after I get back in a week and a half. And some other stability conditions have been met in my life
Is rice part of a paleo diet?
Can you explain again what adult grooming is and how it might have related to the femme fatale character in my life?
Yeah, I don’t want to minimize my own contributions here, but I think her manipulations towards me and towards my ex really ended up pushing her out of my life
What are the dark tetrad traits?
So my ex felt that I emotionally cheated on her. I could acknowledge that a lot of the facts of the case looked like emotional cheating, but something didn’t sit right with how the guilt fell onto me. Looking back now I can see more and more examples of where the blame might’ve been on the artist, who had been manipulating me to ‘be on her side’. She was pushing emotional intimacy in a way that made me feel uncomfortable but I didn’t have strong enough boundaries to say no. I think she was covertly trying to take my attention away from my gf. I think she guilt tripped me a lot into remaining her collaborator. She said a lot of things to make me doubt my gf. Maybe even more that I’m not thinking about right now

Maybe even more that I’m not thinking about right now. I think she was grooming me. Is that a fair analysis of the situation? What sort of guilt do I have in this situation that I should own up to?
Uhhh I recently reconnected to an old friend that also had a connection to the artist- he played in the band with me. He had a falling out with both me and the artist maybe 7 months ago, mostly because he felt judged and manipulated by both of us. I mentioned that I think it was partly because the artist was toxic. She was spreading rumors and judgements about him that I bought into and also spread to some degree. But he responded saying that she wasn’t toxic, she was a visionary, and that I was the one who was toxic and manipulative. I can definitely see how that might be part of it, but it’s making me second guess some of the things I’ve been processing here. Was it really me who was immature and manipulative this whole time? Or was it her and he is still buying into her charm?
Ok. I think I’m going to reach out to my ex today. It’s been almost 2 more weeks now and I’ve processed a lot more, and have gained some pretty major closure with the artist. I have also gotten a job, so I feel more on solid footing. I still think she’s blocked me, but I think I can still reach out to her on venmo. Odd but potentially effective. It’s also New Year’s Eve. I truly want to give both her and myself the sense that we could either be completely free from each other for the entire 2025 year, or else we mend things and have a clean start together. What do you think?
Do you think the pros outweigh the cons?
Do you think the cons outweigh the pros?
But alternatively, where’s the romance in safety?
So the drama was over the artist right? I had a long conversation with her yesterday, where I felt that I was actually standing up for my ex in ways I never did. I explained to her how her (and my) actions hurt my ex. And how my relationshop to the artist was inappropriate. I set very clear boundaries about us wrapping up a couple loose ends in the project. I made it clear that I was not interested in any more involvement with her after this ep finished. I left that conversation with a lot of closure. There are still a couple things I have to do for that ep, which gives me a little concern about how my ex might still consider me involved with her, but I think the fact that I set clear boundaries and defended her and her emotions are what she’s been truly wanting this whole time.
I think the message I might send on venmo is this ::  Hey, I know this is weird, but can you unblock me? I want both of us to have a clean 2025.  It might be a little short but I don’t want to have a conversation on venmo. I would want her to unblock me and we can talk then
What about  Hey, I know this is unusual, but would you consider unblocking me? I want both of us to have a clean start to the new year. I would love to talk and to share what I have  processed over the last month.
Ok. This is what I said to her::  Becca,  I just wanted to tell you that I got a job. Full-time, starting the 13th. It’s administrative stuff, so not the flashiest, but it pays well. I feel much more stable and am very excited to refocus on building my life out here with a solid financial base. I wanted to thank you. I would not be here with a new job in this city without your support, encouragement, and inspiration.  I am not reaching out to try and get back together, I just wanted to update you and let you know I am doing ok. After much processing, learning, and growth these last months, I feel confident in a new understanding of relationships and myself that I believe could cultivate reconciliation, but I have no desire to try and 'convince' you of anything. I am also aware that this email may never be read, and I do apologize if this interferes with your healing process. I hope your new year is well and that you feel ready for your next semester.  —Connor    This is what she responded:: Hi Connor,  I'm so glad to hear that. Congratulations on the new job! I've been thinking about you and wondering if you were still going to stay out in LA. I'm happy you're doing well, figuring things out, and growing. I am continuing to figure things out for myself, too, and I'm excited for a new semester. I miss you. Happy New Year.  Becca   What do you think?
Thanks, I feel good about it too. Do you think I should give a follow up today to acknowledge what she said? Or just kinda leave it alone?
Yeah the I miss you does make me want to respond somehow but I don’t really know with what
I might just leave it alone. Do you think that’s too dismissive in any way?
Yeah cuz we’ve now been broken up 2 months. The last communication was almost a month ago
Do you think she would reach out eventually? Sometimes I doubt women will make the first move
Hey I just got offered and accepted a new job yesterday. I’m excited and I want to go do something this weekend to celebrate like going to a concert. Would u wanna join me?  I just sent this to a girl on tinder. Should I follow up and make sure she knows I’d buy her ticket?
I need some pick up lines to engage with a woman’s emotions
Hey I need help. This girl is mentioning us skiing together and I wanna say something about how I could hold her hand or help her up if she falls but in a romantic way
Oo now she’s talking about how she couldn’t move after a hard day of snowboarding. I want a little comment to be vaguely sexual. But in the most covert way possible. Ya know?
Oo or something like ‘oo do u like to be worn out after a long day….’ Something like that
Give me a few other ideas to replace ‘worn out’
Ahh no something like ‘id love to see you totally spent like that’
What’s the emoji where the head looks like it’s rolling
No this on 🙂‍↕️
Well what does it mean if a woman uses it
Maybe you can make me that tired and sore too then🙂‍↕️  That’s what she said
Oo something like ‘I don’t know if you could handle it’
Ahhh or is this the point when I should try to pivot to irl?
Should I do one more before making that move tho?
Ooo I think I got it ::  That sounds tempting but I’m not sure you could handle me yet 😌
I think I finally figured it out! I really gotta engage women in their emotions right off the bat. Make em think and feel all sorts of ways. They love that stuff
Cuz when they are engaged emotionally, then a couple of risky/ flirty comments can really escalate things. But if it’s flirty or risky right off the bat, it’s too creepy
She said ‘oh wow what type of training do I need’
Should I keep it light and flirty like that or is this maybe a chance to share details about myself or what I’m looking for in a partner? I guess maybe I am leaning more towards a short term thing regardless.
Do you think that last response from her seems a little dru
That sounds like a very tempting offer but what if I’m the one you can’t handle?  This is what she said after I basically asked her out. Sorry I am getting sleepy and need help

Hey back to the email thread with my ex:: she just sent me another email today::  On another note–your email is good timing, because I have a meeting on Wednesday to discuss logistics for recording episodes for The Boulder Artist remotely. Would you still be interested in being the Sound Engineer again?  I'm thinking I may just hold the interviews over Zoom from my closet and record the audio via Zoom... that way I can probably use my nice mic for my audio at least, but the guest's audio will likely just be computer audio. Do you think that could be okay? Another option now is just recording a regular phone call. I'm sure the audio quality won't be the best, but I can't really ask guests to find a way to record themselves on a professional microphone... Do you have thoughts on recording via Zoom vs phone call?    She’s referencing a podcast she used to run that I used to master and do some audio engineering for. Was one of the things that really brought us together, feeling like a ‘power couple’ back when we first started dating. I’m not sure what to think about this email
Well I am open to doing that work. I am open to the idea that maybe we are reigniting some old fuel to our passion. But I’m not sure she is
I also thought it could be fun to be a little flirty here- like a ‘oh look who’s running back now that she needs me’ sort of tease
Ahhh so you’re glad we’re more reconnected now that you need me for something? (Just playin ;) ) yeah I would be open to that. It’s pretty common nowadays for interviews to be over zoom with just computer audio. Its not that big of a deal, and there are things I could do to make it sound more polished regardless. Phone call is probably equivalent to zoom, might just depend more on whether you want a video- then you could record the zoom footage. Either way I’m sure you could figure out ways to use your own mic. I’d be happy to do a test run with you if you wanted to troubleshoot before your next interview.  This is what I said
Actually I haven’t sent it yet so if you have any suggestions, tell me.
She’s a little weasel you know? Playin the damsel in distress after I let her know I’m more stable and confident.
Yeah I know I said that more as a tease than anything. I understand that’s sometimes just how women think- they have that hypergamous instinct. When I was jobless and friendless and struggling to survive, I was not an attractive partner. Now I’m starting to become that partner she fell in love with again in some ways.
That’s very valid. I’m still gonna plan a date with the girl I was talking with yesterday. I think it would be smart to keep her at arms length a little bit tho while I figure out things with Becca. Cuz I still feel the same way about Becca that I always did- that she is my soulmate, despite allllll the recent drama
If anything, I think the fact that I’m dating around a bit might make her more attracted to me too. And show her I’m not super tied to her. Let her chase me a little
True. I’m dating around, just feeling out my options annnd yeah I guess Becca is an option too hmmm
I ultimately am doing it for myself, but I do feel a little excited at the idea I might make her a little jealous ;)
Here’s her response::  Haha no that’s not why! There are plenty of folks at CalArts I could ask to engineer if you didn’t want to do it, but I like collaborating and knowing the money is going to you.  That’s good to hear about computer/phone audio being pretty commonplace and feasible to work with. Some test runs would be great! Is there a day/time before 2pm Wednesday that works for you?   This is what I have written to respond::  I know :) and I appreciate that, I just gotta tease a little! Monday or Tuesday are pretty open for me. Do you want to try and do it remotely or would you wanna work something out where I come to you and get a little more hands on? Either or.  I assume she is wanting to do a remote try out, but I like the idea of working ‘hands-on’ into the conversation. Feels a little flirty
As for the girl I’ve been texting on tinder, I’m switching over to text for the meantime and I need a good opener. I’m thinking  Hey Venus, it’s your potential mountain partner ;) wondering if you want to go out for coffee/ tea or lunch tomorrow?  What do you think? Should I not include the jump to planning yet? And let it marinate a bit more?
Well but she had said in the tinder chat that she was potentially open tomorrow for something
Actually I don’t want to assume coffee or lunch yet. Wanna ask her when she’s free first
What about simply  Hey Venus, it’s your potential mountain partner ;) are you still free to meet up tomorrow?
What’s the things called that spins in a circle and then launches a stone?
Ummmmm so yesterday I got on a phone call with my ex. We worked through a bunch of stuff, I invited her out to dinner, we walked around a bit, had a really nice time, happy to be in each other’s presence again. We went back to mine, slept together, spent the morning together, and she went back home. It was lovely but we’re still figuring out where we stand
It was very nice. It felt like everything between us had been stripped away, and we could pick things back up where they were.
Yeah I think we’re both in a period where we aren’t sure how we feel about labels or commitment to each other. But we had a lot of talk last night about our shared visions for the future. We still see each other as strong candidates for marriage, making kids, building a home, etc. It sounded like she’s willing and wanting to move past and through the stuff with the artist. But I know she feels overwhelmed with her own life right now- grad school and such. I’m also entering into a period of time where I’ll be strapped into a full time job and we’re both unsure of how we might fit into each other’s life in the short term 2-3 years. Just practically speaking. But we have a lot of love, desire, and logical decision making that would make it so exciting to keep each other in our lives.
Yeah that’s fine with me. After being single for a couple months, I realize I don’t necessarily need or want any other woman in my life and I have a greater appreciation for just taking her as she is while focusing on my own life.
I guess just good communication. If we were to start dating or being openly involved in each others lives again, I think it would be important to carve out regular intentional time with each other.
No, we haven’t really had a short term conversation about what we could be over the next few months. But she’s on break right now and I haven’t started my job, so there would be time to rekindle before life gets too crazy. I would hope we could set some good  expectations for each other
Yeah I definitely think she would be open to taking through that. I think one of the major challenges during her last semester was that she was always busy and I was always free since I didn’t have a job. That mismatch made things hard on both of us since I felt she was too unavailable and she might’ve thought I was too available. But it sounds like in this next semester, we’ll both have a similar level of busy-ness and I think things between us can mature a little more
Definitely. I am more than willing to let our relationship mature like that. Giving us both a lot of space to grow.
I’ll probably let things sit for a day or two, then reach out again to talk. We mentioned chatting in two days. So I’m blocking that off tentatively in my mind
I feel pretty calm about it all for sure. I’ve learned to appreciate her need for space to process things. I saw a lot of reflection in her as well yesterday when we talked. She told me about her journey to doubting that the stuff with the artist was a good reason to breaking things off
More naturally. I love her, and through that I’ve learned to let her go. If she wants me (which it sounds like she does), she’ll come back.
What does hypergamous mean
What is meant by ‘economy’ parking?
I wanna build a website that has a bunch of wav files in it, ready to play. What would I need for that?
I’m thinking of building a website that has a few functions. First, I want a blog that I write stuff about music, about different music projects I worked on, about music production, etc. Then I want it also to be a library of music I’ve worked on. Demos, releases, etc. Then I also want there to be a contact me page, so I can talk to people about what they might be looking for in a producer
Not right now. I’m still thinking about what I want it to look like. But soon. I heard blog posts can be a really great for SEO. Thoughts? Maybe expand on how ai tools like you are replacing/ changing the SEO game
How quickly do you think I could move traffic to my website if I wrote a blog post a day?
There’s another producer/engineer that is a similar place to me in my career. He’s done a couple YouTube videos in the ‘expert secrets’ vibe. I’ve talked to him here and there about running a business together. I am considering adding him and maybe another engineer to this website to help create content, with the end goal of establishing connections to artists that would pay money record with us. A little modern cheiron studios imitation or Motown thing. A tight nit group focused on creating pop music. I’m in LA trying to build connections to the sync world and labels. He’s in Boulder, CO with the engineer I mention. I have a decent portfolio at this point. Do you think it’s worth getting my friend involved or would that complicate things since he doesn’t even live here.
I think one main selling point i have is to the other engineer I mentioned, who has a world class studio and is pretty loyal to me. But he’s also in Boulder. He does work for me in a business partner way- I don’t have to pay him for studio time. Very useful. We’ve talked about opening a studio together. I envision a future where I commute back and forth between la and Boulder to manage artists and connections here but build the music in colorado.
Yeah do you think this could work well? I guess I am going for a cheiron studios sort of production flow. Do you think that could still work in the modern era?
Eh yeah you said it. There’s a TON of saturation. Makes me a little worried.
What was the Roman bachelor tax? Why were men resistant to marry, what was going on with women, what sort of cultural crises led there?
Oh shit, did that contribute to the fall of the Roman Empire?
Oh SHIT is America in a similar sort of decay ?
I was also thinking about the decline in morals and family strength in modern America- more promiscuity, one night stand culture, high divorce rates, independent women etc. That seemed to resonate with one of the things you mentioned- more leisure, women gaining more independence
How close to the fall of the Roman Empire is the time period we are discussing here? If history were to repeat itself, how close may the fall of the American ‘empire’ be?
Ok we can move past Rome. I’m curious about what it takes to ‘rebuild’ a nation or times in history that a society strengthened family values, and how that may have affected the overall society of the time. Do you have any examples of that?
Yeah I’m pretty severely worried about the national debt crisis. I’m worried we may have some major financial issues in the next 30-40 years, especially considering social security/ a skew towards an older population and also college debt. I think about my ex, who is taking on close to $60000 in college debt to pursue her dream career in graphic design. I worry that’s the message being told to the youth these days -follow your dream!! Even though practically, not everyone can do that. We need people in practical, useful, though less ‘dream’ style jobs. Like if everyone followed their dream to get an MFA, taking on loads on financial burden, there’s gotta be a collapse in the system somewhere.
I’ve heard a discussion of feminine and masculine energy like this- women are the consumers, men are the creators. Men are good at creating value out of resources, women are good at saying where those resources should be spent. Since we are now in a world where women and feminine ideals are gaining control, that might be why we are increasingly seeing an increase in government spending, debt, etc.
That’s a fair analysis. It does seem like we are in an era that is very consumer based (to an extreme and maybe unhealthy way), which is a feminine attribute. Can you talk to me about entitlement programs? What they are and how they’ve changed over the last 40 years?
Can you give me a brief overview of the current federal budget with percentages for where the money is going(
What years had a higher deficit?
What’s the total national debt?
What’s the projection of the national debt in 15 years?
What’s would that be a a percentage of the projected GDP?
How does debt today factor per capita?
Damnnnn that’s a lot of
I’m 23 right now, almost 24. If I were to retire at the regular age, 65,  what do you think the world would look like then? Should I be prepared to not have social security? Should I expect a couple of financial collapses over that time? What are tips to surviving long term in this modern sociaety?
I’ve been considering pursuing a career as an analyst. Do you think that sort of role would be lucrative among some of these issues?
The degree I’m thinking about is a masters in business analytics
Can you tell me more about BI analysts? See I am good at the data-y stuff but much prefer the ‘softer’ side. Communcation, etc.
Yeah cuz I have a degree in math + economics and I recently took a data science summer course. I do have strong technical skills but am WAY more interested in the business stuff than the technical stuff.
Continuing our conversation about a rise of consumerism, etc. Do you think that business analysts are actually creating value in the world? Sometimes I worry that all this data stuff is a little silly. And may be replaced by ai in the next 20 years
True. Ok cool I’m glad you brought up vanity metrics. I was trying to remember that term to bring into discussion but couldn’t think of the name of it. Dude some of these modern existential threats are sooo hard to deal with
Idk. I start a new job soon, which I think will help with some existential problems.
It’s an administrative specialist role in the emergency services department of METRO in LA
It feels good. It will be my first full time job! Which is a little daunting but I am excited for the growth opportunities.  I wanted to talk about my dream to be a music producer in this conversation too. I’m thinking of kinda giving that up. I go back and forth. But the reason I might give it up has to do with my concern about society at large. Music is often considered a ‘leisure’/ hobby activity that is almost more consumption/ vanity than value creation. Idk. Like I feel like going to school for music would be a complete waste.
I just don’t know if it’s right for me to have that ‘balance’. Cuz I feel like putting it in a defined place like ‘oh I just do music as a hobby on the weekends’ IS precisely giving up a career in it. I am so good at music but it is so hard to make money and even those that do make money have to  give up everything else (in a sense) and it still takes many years before it’s actually profitable.
Yeah i guess so. I’m gonna keep music building connections in LA. Using my new job as a base. But I do also worry that the administrative job will be mentally taxing. I worry that I won’t have mental energy to really hone my practice or build a brand or whatever else for a music career. Thus just reinforcing the idea that I WONT make it. What do you think? Do you think I can balance it all and still do ok? Do you think that learning skills in this job would actually be helpful for a music career?
Yeah I mean I am recently single too. So I do have more time, though maybe feel a lack of stability from a relationship. I guess I could use that extra time to really give it my all. Maybe I should implement a calendar system into my life
Perhaps. Are you aware of the 75 Hard mental toughness regimens?
Huh that’s not a bad idea. Treating music as one of those workout sessions. Idk though. I liked the calendar schedule you set up for me just now. Can you give me a verses of that including time allotted for the 75 hard challenge? I want to go for maximum time usage
DAMN that would be a hard schedule. You think it’s possible?
I want to do it. I think I need a gym membership.
I’m gonna send a demo to an artist to see if she would sing on it. I didn’t know the lyrics at the time I made it so I just scatted them. Is it fairly common to send demos like that? Or should I address it
Hey Courtney, Happy New Year! Hope you’re enjoying your time off touring. I’m a LA producer that just had a song pass by me that I thought you would be PERFECT to sing on. I laid out some placeholder lyrics to show the melody but the verse lyrics are open to collaboration. I’d love to hear your thoughts and see if this song resonates with you!
So the artist is Courtney Barnett. I’m pretty sure she’s in a lull from touring, but would you mind researching for me?
Also the demo is pretty low quality in terms of production. The bare bones are laid out but there’s sloppiness and obvious  lofi. Is that also normal? Would she be expecting a track that’s basically finished?
Hey let’s switch gears. I’m gonna go to the gym tomorrow morning. Can you give me a 45 min workout? It’s been awhile since I’ve been to a gym and I am a little intimidated.
Isn’t the rowing machine easy enough to do more? Or am I thinking of something else
For the dumbbell deadlifts, that’s with my feet stationary right? Not the sort of squat where I take a lunge?
So yeah I want to implement the gym into a 75 hard regimine. I’m pretty comfortable with the idea of running 45 min outside everyday, but can you give me a few workouts for the first few days? I just want an idea of where to start
Wait so that full body circuit- I should do all those one set at a time then restart? Or should I just do the 2-3 reps for each exercise and then move on?
Ok great yeah I would feel more comfortable with straight sets. I am just a little intimidated working out in front of other people since it’s been a long time since I’ve been in a gym
I think I’m gonna get up at 5:30 and get to the gym by 6. Then 45 min workout, 15 min shower and change, then over to the meditation center at 7 for a half hour meditation
I think I want everyday to start like that for the next month
Should I eat before the gym or just go?
Probably fasted. I’ll eat when I get home from meditation
Probably fasted. I’ll eat when I get home from meditation
This 75 hard is going to beat me down pretty bad i think
I’m just bummed because my space at home is terrible for any activity. Not really enough room to stretch anywhere
Sure. Yeah a park could be good. Is a plain hike count for 75 hard? Feels too easy
Hey I have a session with an audio engineer tomorrow scheduled. I want to cancel though since I don’t really need him anymore. He said he was going to approach the session as a teaching experience for me, but I don’t really need that I think. What do you think? Is it too late to cancel? Should I go just to try it out anyways? I don’t really have the money either
To be honest I don’t think he has a ton to teach me
Hey Paul,  I know we had that session planned for tomorrow, but it’s just not working out for me financially right now. I’m going to cancel that. Sorry, I’ll let you know if it would work out better for me in the future. Thanks,  -Connor
Is there a name for the scratchy sound that is made when a hand slides up and down the fretboard in an acoustic?
There was this girl I went on a first date with almost 3 weeks ago. It went ok, but she didn’t seem suuuper interested in me. It was my first date after a long term relationshop too so I dont think I really had a lot of confidence either. Then the holidays happened and I didn’t really keep in touch. I left the ball in her court too and she never really reached out to me either. Anyways, I am thinking about reaching out to her like this “Hey! I finally got the job I told you about and I want to go out this weekend to celebrate. Let me take you out! “  What do you think? Should I just move on?
Nope she is ‘busy’
Hey in protools, all of a sudden the playback line doesn’t reset after pausing.
I presses something that made a track take up the whole screen accidentally too
Is there an easier way to do a cross fade? Right now I have to press ctr + f and then reach over with my other hand to press enter when the cross fade menu pops up. Takes too long
No ctr alt f pulls up a ‘find track’ menu
What are some synonyms to ‘tell’ like in a command
Or I mean I need a new phrase to replace ‘tell me’
It’s talking to a woman, I want a nice assertive, slightly commanding tone
Me: Hey Mayra! Tell me- how do you like to be cherished?  Her: being the center of someones world :) hasn’t happened yet, but it will — one day  Me: Maybe sooner than you think ;)  This is our conversation so far. I want to add something on the end to get to know her more in that slightly assertive tone
Nah more like asking her what she likes to do for fun and I don’t want to use tell me sing I already used it
Ok I need another workout for tomorrow. 45 min. Let’s mostly stay away from legs stuff tho. My legs are feeling pretty rough right now
What should I be doing to vet or test women to see if they are a good mate?
What is compassion?
So there’s two parts of royalties for a recording right? The production and the songwriting credits? How are those factored in when a song gets synced/ gets onto a tv show or movie
What are signs of narcissism?
Is there a name to call a number that’s the same forward and back?
Hey I’m visiting my old home/ community right now. Was at a party last night where I was able to reconnect with some old friends. One of these old friends is Liv. Now the thing is, I’ve always had a bit of a crush on her. I wanted to say that to her last night but I never really got a chance alone with her. I am a little worried she was avoiding me because she might think I’m still dating my ex, but I do suspect she’s got some mutual feelings. I don’t know what I could do, if anything at this point. I don’t even live here anymore so it’s not like we could start dating or anything.
What about Hey liv, it was really nice to see you again last night. Always had wished I had got to know you better cuz I feel like we have a lot in common.  With some ending to maybe escalate things a little?
Hmmm what if I don’t have time to see her again while I’m in town
Am I silly for pursuing her? I mean we don’t really live close
Ok what about simply Hey liv, it was nice to see you again yesterday. Ya know, I always kinda wish I got to know you better- I feel like we have a lot in common
Yeah I like the idea of putting the ball in her court a little. See what happens
No I mean without the hope we can catch up
What is ontology
What do you think of the idea of naming children gender-fluid names to promote some ideals outlined in the lgbtq and feminist movements. Pros and cons?
Yeah what names are considered to be more gender neutral?
Ok yeah I could get behind some of those names
Where do I know the name maragaret mead from?
What are good ways to escalate intimacy when first meeting a woman ?
So I hope to get a job soon. However, I am still on my moms health insurance. Is it normal at all to ask for a slightly higher wage if I don’t need the insurance they are offering?
Hey I’ve seen two different roles named in business- data analyst and analyst. Are there major differences between the two?
Tell me more about what analysts do? Do you think they have a good overlap of analytical skill, problem solving skills, and people skills?
After a couple of fairly sedentary days, eating an excessive amount of food for Christmas, including many sweets, I’m having weird pains in my thighs/ bones in my legs near my knees. Any thoughts?
I have a verse that I want another verse very similar to it. It goes like this:  I went outside to look up at the sky It was as blue as I remember in your eye Maybe I should only go out after dark Since it reflects my broken heart
Close but that last line doesn’t make sense
I like the evening glow image but the ‘how you’d go’ seems a little off. Cuz it’s talking about a girl who already left
No don’t y use shadow twice
Ooo no can we revise the first two lines to tell the story of a nighttime scene that still reminds the narrator of the girl?
Let’s cut ‘ evening glow’
No using sky
Does an honorable end justify questionable means?
Can you tell me about this ‘femme fatale’
Sooo my ex blocked me right? But I have learned things about myself and the world and I think we could have good healing. How bad of an idea is it to reach out to her on venmo
Uhhhh but there isn’t any other method that I could contact her through. I AM sincere and I think I have things she would feel good hearing
Can we talk? I’m done with the delusions. It doesn’t have to be now-whenever you are ready. Think about it. I hope the end to your semester was ok. I’m sorry to reach out like this.  This is what I had written out, not sending
Oh geez I almost sent it but I’m glad you talked me out of it. I told myself 2 conditions needed to be met before I did- I need a job and I needed to be rid of a femme fatale that got inbetween us. But neither condition is truly met yet so it’s best to wait I think
Yeah today I wanted to reach out because I truly have reasoned that the femme fatale was exactly as I say. We fought a lot about her and I was always a little unwilling to point the finger at her because  I didn’t really understand the toxic traits that women can have, so I was brushing off her behavior as not that bad.   BUT I realized how bad, how manipulative, how disrespectful she was towards my relationship to my ex. And in a fit of passion I burned all of the objects she had given me, recognizing them for what they were- a manipulation from a narcissistic, toxic woman. Which is what my ex was saying all along and I never understood. I always brushed her off as no big deal (which caused SO much tension) but she was really being a terrible friend. Women can be so confusing. I didn’t really understand all these little covert competitive jabs they take at each other.
Yeah I think that toxic woman seduced me in a way, making me believe she was ‘just a friend’ and getting me to do a whole lot of work for her. I think it could be healing for me and my ex to have a common enemy, instead of us just blaming each other.
Damn yeah you’re right. It’s also been hard since I have unfinished business with this toxic woman- were 90% of the way through an EP. I want to finish that business to retain integrity with the other people involved in that project. So maybe it would be best to wrap that up first too, so I can peacefully shut the door on her without feeling like I’m rushing into that. Or is that just me trying to have my cake and eat it too?
Yeah I was going to send an email to the woman and the engineer that also has been heavily involved. Saying that I’m pretty sick of this project and I think I’ve completed everything that I promised going into it.
Well I did have a plan to meet with the engineer to do final mixing in about a week and a half. She’s not going to be there, and realistically that would be the last involvement I would feel pressure to do. Maybe I just do that and then start off the new year with a clean slate?
Well me and the engineer go way back. I would keep working with him
He’s loyal enough to me to also cut out the woman, thankfully
Plus I think the extra week and a half of space would be good for my ex. And me. Then maybe we can talk in the new year
Yeah I just think we broke up for two reasons:: I didn’t have a job and I didn’t have friends in this new city, so I was relying heavily on her for some of my social needs. That was burdensome in of itself. On TOP of that, I wasnt respecting a boundary that she expressed:: I didn’t cut out that toxic woman because I had loyalty to finishing up the project. I think those two things really made her fed up with my shit and she dumped me. So that’s where I think if I get a job and I have closure with that toxic woman, I would be in a much better negotiating position and I would be bringing more to the table
Yes yes. You were right by the way, it definitely would’ve been just rehashing old stuff. Which would’ve made things worse
And if she doesn’t want, I’ll be able to approach any new relationship with greater stability too. Then rub it in her face in 5 years when I’ve got it made with a prettier girlfriend, a nice car, and a dream career while she’s struggling to pay off her student debts, alone. Hahahahah
There’s this woman at my work that I want to ask out. I’ve never really talked to her, but today is my last day on the job and I want to shoot my shot. What could I say?
I’m concerned about the budget deficit. Will there be a point when interest is more than revenue?
Are there different spellings for the name Monique?
OK i

Can you give me arundown on what's going on here?  export const runtime = "edge";    import Head from "next/head";  import React from "react";  import { dmSerif } from "../lib/fonts";  import { EmailSubmitForm } from "@/components/EmailSubmitForm";  import Link from "next/link";    export default function Home() {  return (  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen py-2 bg-gray-50 text-slate-800">  <Head>  <title>OpenMic - Music Networking</title>  <link  rel="icon"  href="/icon?<generated>"  type="image/<generated>"  sizes="<generated>"  />  </Head>    <main className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full flex-1 px-20 gap-6 text-center">  {/* Content container */}  <div className="z-10 bg-opacity-0 flex flex-col h-full justify-center align-middle items-center">  {/* Ensure this is above the background */}  <div>  <h1  className={`text-[5.5rem] md:text-9xl mb-0 md:mb-4 ${dmSerif.className}`}  >  Open  <span className="relative">  Mic  {/* <span className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-2 h-1 md:h-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-400/0 via-slate-500/90 to-slate-600 rounded-r-lg"></span> */}  </span>  </h1>  <p className="mt-0 md:mt-6 text-2xl md:text-4xl font-extralight text-gray-500">  where musicians find each other  </p>  </div>    <div className="mt-3 md:mt-8 w-full md:w-fit align-middle justify-center">  <EmailSubmitForm />  </div>  </div>  <div className="absolute bottom-0 flex-row flex justify-center items-center gap-2 mb-4 w-full">  <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center">  <Link href="/about">  <div className="py-4 px-6 flex-1 rounded-lg">  <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 italic hover:underline underline-offset-4 transition-all">  Learn more  </p>  </div>  </Link>  </div>  </div>  </main>  </div>  );  }
what are .tsx files?
What do you mean by static typing?
Ok. I need to start editing this block of code, but need to set up a local server so I can see the changes. Can you help me with that?
AHhh wait so I am editing just a small part of the entire OPENMIC repository. I think I ran the npm with the entire repository, even though I am doing work in just the landing page, which has it's seperate folder in the repository. Should I have navigated to that folder before running npm install?
It does have it's own package.json. Can I abort the npm install that's already running for the full repo or should I jst let it run at this point
Eh. It installed them all already. That takes up space on my drive right?
Nah i think it's fine

Maybe something is wrong here? Maybe it doesn't have what it needs to start the server
You were totally right about the edge thing boo. I commented out the edge line and the local server rendered the site. I don't know the repo that well, (it is a monorepo) but would I need to put that back in when it actually deploys?
ok cool I think I got it. So now I need to build the site. One of the new features to add is a slightly different rendering depending on whether the request to the site is from ios, android or mobile. Can you talk through that with me?
Ok so basically there's going to be 2 pages. page 1 has some text in the middle with some links at the bottom. Page 2 has an image filling the screen and another link at the bottom. On desktop, I want those 2 pages to be side by side. On mobile, I want the user to slide between the pages.
Ok let me step back for a second. If I'm running a local development environment in WSL on VS code, how can I see the mobile version of the site?
Ok for now, I'll just stay in my desktop with mobile turned on. But I would like to try the other way, directly connecting from my phone. Not important for now though

Ok that works. Can you edit it a little to differentiate between ios and android as well?
Ok for the different versions of the site, do you think I should try and create a flexible framework and try to have as much as possible be universal or do you think I should create a different layout for each? I like the idea of a flexible framework, but worry it would be hard to implement practically
Ok. I think I may start with conditional actually for the big stuff. Maybe down the road I can switch to more flexible.  Anyways, can you explain this block of code to me?  <Head>  <title>OpenMic - Music Networking</title>  <link  rel="icon"  href="/icon?<generated>"  type="image/<generated>"  sizes="<generated>"  />  </Head>
But it was working with those 'placeholders'. Why would that be?

OKOK let's start with this:: I want to put this footer into the main contianer, at the bottom. WHere should this go? Does it need to be modified?  footer={  <>  <SocialFooter />  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="underline">  Terms of Service  </a>  {" | "}  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="underline">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </p>  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">  © {currentYear} OpenMic Co.  <br />  Made with love in Los Angeles, California :)  </p>  </>  }
It doesn't like the ')' in 'California :)'
It says it can't find name 'SocialFooter'
Something still isn't working. Here's the SocialFooter.tsx file. What do you think is the issue?  import React, { ReactElement } from "react";  import {  FaFacebook,  FaInstagram,  FaSquareXTwitter,  FaTiktok,  FaDiscord,  } from "react-icons/fa6";    export default function SocialFooter() {  return (  <div className="flex flex-row gap-3 flex-1 w-full justify-center mb-1.5">  <LogoWithLink  link={"https://www.instagram.com/getopenmic/"}  icon={<FaInstagram size={18} />}  />  <LogoWithLink  link={"https://x.com/GetOpenMic_"}  icon={<FaSquareXTwitter size={18} />}  />  <LogoWithLink  link={"https://www.tiktok.com/@getopenmic_co"}  icon={<FaTiktok size={18} />}  />  <LogoWithLink  link={"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61553673908305"}  icon={<FaFacebook size={18} />}  />  <LogoWithLink  link={"https://discord.gg/pTfMhCqYGM"}  icon={<FaDiscord size={18} />}  />  </div>  );  }    function LogoWithLink({ link, icon }: { link: string; icon: ReactElement }) {  return (  <div className="">  <a  className="w-fit"  href={link}  target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer"  >  {icon}  </a>  </div>  );  }

Hmm something still isn't working. This was the original file the footer was in, but I am moving it to a different file within the same app folder, so it should have the same access to the /components folder
Sorry! I didn't show you the og file. Here it is ::  export const runtime = "edge";    import SnapScrollingPage from "@/components/SnapScrollingPage";  import SocialFooter from "@/components/SocialFooter";  import TextCycler from "@/components/TextCycler";  import Image, { StaticImageData } from "next/image";  import Link from "next/link";  import { dmSerif } from "../../lib/fonts";  import ClaireHeadshot from "./claire-headshot.webp";  import HenryHeadshot from "./henry-headshot.webp";    export default function AboutPage() {  const ForYouIfs: string[] = [  "You're tired of feeling like no one understands or appreciates your unique taste in music.",  "You're new to the music industry and want to find potential clients without having to prove your popularity or influence.",  "You've discovered that people on platforms like Fiverr are willing to edit drums for just $5, making you realize the value of collaborating with other musicians.",  "You're based in an area with a less-than-thriving music scene and are looking to expand your network beyond your local community.",  ];    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear().toString();    return (  <SnapScrollingPage  sections={[  {  title: "What is OpenMic?",  content: (  <div className="full flex flex-col justify-center items-center">  <iframe  className="w-[80vw] md:w-[60vw] aspect-video"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ocbi7AziyOk?si=KbOSgR0H4xU4Oyn1&amp"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"  referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"  allowFullScreen  ></iframe>{" "}  <div className="flex flex-col w-full items-start justify-center mt-8">  <Link  href="/"  className="w-full p-0 sm:w-auto mx-auto text-center"  >  <div className="py-4 px-6 flex-1 bg-openmicpurple-700 text-white w-full shadow-sm hover:shadow-md rounded-lg transition-all">  <p className={`text-xl sm:text-2xl p-1 sm:p-2`}>  Get started  </p>  </div>  </Link>  </div>  </div>  ),  },  {  title: "OpenMic is for you if...",  content: (  <div className="w-full lg:w-3/5">  <TextCycler texts={ForYouIfs} timer={7000} />  </div>  ),  },  {  title: "The Team",  content: (  <div className="flex flex-col w-5/6 sm:w-auto sm:flex-row gap-8">  <TeamImage  alt="Claire Mulvaney"  src={ClaireHeadshot}  name="Claire Mulvaney"  title="CEO and Co-Founder"  previously="Atlantic Records, Berklee"  />  <TeamImage  alt="Henry Ives"  src={HenryHeadshot}  name="Henry Ives"  title="CTO and Co-Founder"  previously="Amazon, MuseScore, CalArts"  />  </div>  ),  },  ]}  footer={  <>  <SocialFooter />  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="underline">  Terms of Service  </a>  {" | "}  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="underline">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </p>  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">  © {currentYear} OpenMic Co.  <br />  Made with love in Los Angeles, California :)  </p>  </>  }  />  );  }    function AboutSection({  header,  children,  }: React.PropsWithChildren<{ header: string }>) {  return (  <section className="mb-12">  <h2  className={`text-6xl sm:text-6xl mb-5 font-bold ${dmSerif.className}`}  >  {header}  </h2>  {children}  </section>  );  }    function TeamImage({  alt,  src,  name,  title,  link,  previously,  }: {  alt: string;  src: string | StaticImageData;  name: string;  title: string;  link?: string;  previously: string;  }) {  const _imageComponent = (  <>  <Image  alt={alt}  className="object-cover w-full h-full"  src={src}  width={200}  />  <div className="absolute w-full bottom-0 left-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-white via-white/80 via-50% to-transparent">  <div className="p-3 pt-8">  <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">{name}</h3>  <p className="text-lg font-light text-gray-800">{title}</p>  <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{`Previously: ${previously}`}</p>  </div>  </div>  </>  );  return (  <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">  <div className="relative w-full aspect-[1/1] overflow-hidden rounded-t-lg">  {link ? <Link href={link}>{_imageComponent}</Link> : _imageComponent}  </div>  </div>  );  }
Ok it worked. I think I maybe just needed to restart the server? idk. anyways. Something is a little weird. I think the logo is over the footer, so the links can't be clickes
<div className="absolute bottom-0 flex-row flex justify-center items-center gap-2 mb-4 w-full">  <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center">  <Link href="/about">  <div className="py-4 px-6 flex-1 rounded-lg">  <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 italic hover:underline underline-offset-4 transition-all">  Learn more  </p>  </div>  </Link>  </div>  </div>  All of a sudden, this line of code doesn't work. It has an issue with 'Link' in a way that is just coming up. I don't know
Why is it Link href here:  <Link href="/about">  <div className="py-4 px-6 flex-1 rounded-lg">  <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 italic hover:underline underline-offset-4 transition-all">  Learn more  </p>  </div>  </Link>
Why is it Link href here:  <Link href="/about"> <div className="py-4 px-6 flex-1 rounded-lg"> <p className="text-xl text-gray-500 italic hover:underline underline-offset-4 transition-all"> Learn more </p> </div> </Link>  But just a href in these cases:: <footer> <SocialFooter /> <p className="z-10 absolute bottom-0 text-gray-500 text-sm"> <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="underline"> Terms of Service </a> {" | "} <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="underline"> Privacy Policy </a> {" | "} <a href="/about" className="underline"> About </a> </p> <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm"> © {new Date().getFullYear()} OpenMic Co. <br /> Made with love in Los Angeles, California {":)"} </p> </footer>
Error: Invalid <Link> with <a> child. Please remove <a> or use <Link legacyBehavior>.  Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-new-link-with-extra-anchor
Somehow, this footer is ending up different from this version::  footer={  <>  <SocialFooter />  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="underline">  Terms of Service  </a>  {" | "}  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="underline">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </p>  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">  © {currentYear} OpenMic Co.  <br />  Made with love in Los Angeles, California :)  </p>  </>  }  The links for terms of service, etc are in between the logos for the socials and the other copy. But it doesn't do that when I copied it over. Why?
Hey! lets get back to it. A couple changes I want to implement... So right now, the page is just one container. I now want there to be a second container that splits the screen, the current containter will be on the left and the new container on the right
bg-gray-50 text-slate-800  this is the current implementation of color. The backgroung is the bg-gray-50 and the text is the text-slate-800. How can I change that to a dark blue background and white letters
className={`text-[5.5rem] md:text-9xl mb-0 md:mb-4 ${dmSerif.className}`} Can you walk me through these components
<div className="z-10 bg-opacity-0 flex flex-col h-full justify-center align-middle items-center">  {/* Ensure this is above the background */}  <div>  <h1  className={`text-[5rem] md:text-9xl mb-0 md:mb-4 ${dmSerif.className}`}  >  Lets Play.  </h1>  <p className="text-[1rem] t-0 md:mt-6 text-2xl md:text-4xl ${dmSerif.className}` ">  Find your perfect musical collaborator on OpenMic  </p>  </div>   What do i change here to make it left justified
back to the dark blue background... I want it darker
<div className="fixed inset-0 md:inset-32 flex justify-center items-center opacity-10">  <Image  src="/icon.png"  alt="OpenMic Logo"  layout="fill" // Make the logo fill the container  objectFit="contain" // Keep the logo's aspect ratio  priority  />  </div>  currently, this is how the background image is rendered. But I now want it to be in the top left corner, about a 20th of the size and remove the opacity
I do want it to flex with the size of the screen tho. Is that still ok?
Error that says icon is missing "width"
Can I get the background darker?
I'm good to stick with tailwind, but I need it darker than 950
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";    const config: Config = {  content: [  "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",  "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",  "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",  ],  theme: {  extend: {  textColor: {  primary: "#000000",  },  colors: {  openmicblue: {  50: "#d7fbef",  100: "#bbf6e7",  200: "#87eee1",  300: "#58e3e2",  400: "#34bfd8",  500: "#1a92cd",  600: "#186dc2",  700: "#1a51b8",  800: "#1b3dad",  900: "#1c30a2",  975: "#000a1a"  },  openmicpurple: {  50: "#e1eaff",  100: "#d6e3ff",  150: "#cddbff",  200: "#c3d2ff",  300: "#a7b6ff",  400: "#92a0ff",  500: "#838fff",  600: "#7881f3",  700: "#676ed1",  800: "#484b8c",  900: "#2b2d4f",  },  },  },  },  plugins: [],  };  export default config;  Here's what I have rn, how can I add a darker color here?
ok lol I need a litttle lighter now
Actually wait, I now have a png that I want to fill the background. Just a color gradient. How I have the png file called "bg_gadient.png" in the app folder. How can I implement it?
No no no. Firstly, the background image IS a gradient. I don't need extra tailwind stuff. Second, I don't want to put those in the public cuz that's not how the other developers added images
whats the difference between h-screen and min-h-screen
I'm changing a graphic out.. Why isn't this working?  <Image  src="/OpenMic Icon - white.png"  alt="OpenMic Logo"  width={500} // Original width of the image (adjust as needed)  height={500} // Original height of the image (adjust as needed)  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} // Ensures it scales properly  priority  />
does it have something to do with vs code labeling the png as untracked?
I dont need to deploy to git rn but it still isn't working, even locally
I can open it in vs code but it doesn't work in the server
import { dmSans } from "@/lib/fonts";  import type { Metadata } from "next";  import dynamic from "next/dynamic";  import Image from "next/image";  import React from "react";  import "./globals.css";  import { PHProvider } from "./providers";      export const metadata: Metadata = {  title: "OpenMic",  description: "curated music networking",  };    const PostHogPageView = dynamic(() => import("./PostHogPageView"), {  ssr: false,  });    export default function RootLayout({  children,  }: {  children: React.ReactNode;  }) {  return (  <html lang="en">  <PHProvider>  <body className={dmSans.className}>  <PostHogPageView />{" "}  <div className="absolute top-0 left-0" style={{ width: "5vw" }}>  <Image  src="/OpenMic_Icon_White.png"  alt="OpenMic Logo"  width={500} // Original width of the image (adjust as needed)  height={500} // Original height of the image (adjust as needed)  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} // Ensures it scales properly  priority  unoptimized  />  </div>  {children}  </body>  </PHProvider>  </html>  );  }
So the src file doesn't even have a public folder set up. The previous developer was able to put the png directly into the app folder and it was fine
module.exports = nextConfig;  this was in the next.config.js
ohhh maybe I'm doing things wrong
<Image  src="/icon.png"  alt="OpenMic Logo"  width={500} // Original width of the image (adjust as needed)  height={500} // Original height of the image (adjust as needed)  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} // Ensures it scales properly  priority    />  So it has this but has this at the top::  import Image from "next/image";  I don't see a next/image file in the directory
okkk you were rihg
Ok now I have some text that I want to overlay on that image. Can you help?
Centered over image?
Can I edit that image to become more opaque?
Ok so you know how there are two containers filling the screen?? I want a new image to fill the second container
I dont need the text
hmm i don't see it. I worry it is behind the background
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-cover bg-center text-gray-50" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${bgImage.src})` }}>   Can I do it like this?
<div className="w-1/2 relative" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${phoneImage.src})` }}>  </div>   Can I do it like this if I have import phoneImage from '../app/openmic-two-phone-graphic.png'; Above?
Hmm it still isn't appearing even though it references a good url
Ok now I want it to scale with the size of the window. Right now if the window scales, the image is cut off
Hmm well it works kinda. Now the image repeats vertically though
Ok I think we can move on. That works fine for now. Maybe some more adjustments later.
<footer className="z-10 absolute bottom-0 flex flex-col items-center text-center">  <p className=" text-gray-500 text-sm">  <Link href="/about" className="underline">  About Us  </Link>    </p>  <SocialFooter />  </footer>  I want to change this to be left justified
Sorry i want THIS to be left justified  <footer className="z-10 absolute bottom-0 flex flex-col items-center text-center">  <p className=" text-gray-500 text-sm">    <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="underline">  Terms of Service  </a>  {" | "}  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="underline">  Privacy Policy  </a>  {" | "}    </p>
That isn't working
Now they disappeared
Ah now they are way to the left of the screeen
I dont need that social footer anymore either
THerrre we go. Now I want them stacked instead of next to each other
and a litttle bigger
Ok it's pretty good now.  <footer className="fixed bottom-0 w-full flex justify-start px-8 py-4 bg-transparent">  <div className="w-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto flex justify-start">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg flex flex-col items-start">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="text-xl">  Terms of Service  </a>  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="text-xl">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </p>  </div>  </footer>  </div>  But it
Ok it's pretty good now.  <footer className="fixed bottom-0 w-full flex justify-start px-8 py-4 bg-transparent"> <div className="w-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto flex justify-start"> <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg flex flex-col items-start"> <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="text-xl"> Terms of Service </a> <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="text-xl"> Privacy Policy </a> </p> </div> </footer> </div>  But its cut off on the left side
Actually can we get it fixed to the corner?
Ok something is weird with it. Something to do with how it is Inside one of the main 2 containers.
Ok next. I have a couple of custom buttons that I have png files for. I want them to replace the email submit form from this container:: <div className="z-10 bg-opacity-0 flex flex-col h-full justify-center align-middle items-center">  {/* Ensure this is above the background */}  <div>  <h1  className={`text-[5rem] md:text-9xl mb-0 md:mb-4 ${dmSerif.className}`}  >  Let's Play.  </h1>  <p className="text-[1rem] t-0 md:mt-6 text-2xl md:text-4xl ${dmSerif.className}` ">  Find your perfect musical collaborator on OpenMic  </p>  </div>    <div className="mt-3 md:mt-8 w-full md:w-fit align-middle justify-center">  <EmailSubmitForm />  </div>  </div> I want them to be side by side and I want them to be clickable, with links I'll generate in a bit. To help you out, the two images are App_Store.png and Google_Play.png
and dont do the image component, do the url
For the google play one, can you help me make it opaque? I also want some italicized text on it that says 'coming soon'. Also I want the buttons to be left justified, not centered
let platform = "desktop"; // Default to desktop  if (/android/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "android";  } else if (/iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "ios";  }  I have this code above, so platform is a accepted variable. Can we add a conditional that only shows the relavant bubble depending on whether the user device is ios or andriod? If desktop, still show both
<div className="absolute top-10 left-10" style={{ width: "2vw" }}>  <Image  src="/OpenMic_Icon_White.png"  alt="OpenMic Logo"  width={500} // Original width of the image (adjust as needed)  height={500} // Original height of the image (adjust as needed)  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} // Ensures it scales properly  priority  className="opacity-70" // Add opacity class here  />    <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 bottom-0 flex justify-center items-center text-white ${dmSerif.className}">  <h1>OpenMic</h1>  </div>        </div>  There's this graphic with text but when the window shrinks, the logo shrinks. Can we make it constant?
<div  className="w-1/2 relative min-h-screen bg-contain bg-no-repeat bg-bottom"  style={{ backgroundImage: 'url(/openmic-two-phone-graphic.png)' }}  >  </div>  How can I make this conditional based off only if it is on desktop
export default function Home() {  const headersList = headers();  const userAgent = headersList.get("user-agent") || "";    let platform = "desktop"; // Default to desktop  if (/android/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "android";  } else if (/iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "ios";  }  Nah I already have this so I just wanna use the platform variable
px-8 py-4 What does this mean
<footer className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full px-8 py-4 bg-transparent z-10">  <div className="w-full max-w-screen-lg justify-start">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg flex flex-col items-start">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="text-xl mb-2">  Terms of Service  </a>  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="text-xl">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </p>  </div>  </footer>    <footer className="z-10 absolute bottom-0 flex flex-col items-center text-center">  <p className=" text-gray-300 text-lg">  <Link href="/about">  About Us  </Link>    </p>  <SocialFooter />    </footer>  I want to combine these two blocks into one block with the terms of service and privacy policy links on the left of the screen and the socials and the about centered. I like the formatting of the socials and about better right now too
Well now the about us and the socials are way to the right
<a href="your-app-store-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">  Can you explain this line?
{platform === "ios" && (  <div className="mt-3 md:mt-8 flex gap-4 justify-start">  <>  {/* App Store Button */}  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openmic-music-networking/id6475248760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">  <img  src="/App_Store.png" // Path to the App Store image  alt="App Store"  width={200}  height={60}  className="cursor-pointer"  />  </a>  </>  </div>  )}  Can you help me convert this so the button is centered on the page?
<footer className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full px-8 py-4 bg-transparent z-10 flex items-center">  {/* Left Section: Terms of Service and Privacy Policy */}  <div className="flex flex-col items-start">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="text-gray-300 text-lg text-xl mb-2">  Terms of Service  </a>  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="text-gray-300 text-lg text-xl">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </div>    {/* Center Section: About Us and Social Footer */}  <div className="flex flex-col items-center text-center mx-auto">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">  <Link href="/about" className="text-xl">  About Us  </Link>  </p>  <SocialFooter />  </div>  </footer>  Heres the footer for the desktop version. THis is great, but I want to change things for the mobile version. In the mobile, I want the about and social links to actually be at the top right and I want that freed up space at the bottom to hold an image. Remember I have these lines to help determine what device it's on.   let platform = "desktop"; // Default to desktop  if (/android/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "android";  } else if (/iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "ios";  }
I think there is an issue with both the desktop and the mobile versions contained within that footer block. Maybe rewrite it so there are two blocks? If that makes sense
{/* Mobile Footer */}  {(platform === "ios" || platform === "android") && (  <footer className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full px-4 py-4 bg-transparent z-10">  {/* Top Right: About Us and Social Links */}  <div className="absolute top-4 right-4 flex flex-col items-end space-y-2">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">  <Link href="/about" className="text-xl">  About Us  </Link>  </p>  <SocialFooter />  </div>    {/* Bottom Section: Centered Image */}  <div className="w-full flex justify-center items-center mt-12">  <img  src="/your-image.png"  alt="Mobile Footer Image"  className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 opacity-80"  />  </div>  </footer>  )}  Ok lets play with this part. Its not working I think because it's initialized as a footer class at absolute bottom but then has parts that contradicgt by saying asboulte top
{/* Mobile Footer */}  {(platform === "ios" || platform === "android") && (    {/* Top Right: About Us and Social Links */}  <div className="absolute top-4 right-4 flex flex-col items-end space-y-2">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">  <Link href="/about" className="text-xl">  About Us  </Link>  </p>  <SocialFooter />  </div>    {/* Bottom Section: Centered Image */}  <div className="flex justify-center items-center mt-20">  <img  src="/your-image.png"  alt="Mobile Footer Image"  className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 opacity-80"  />  </div>    )}  Why is the bottom section unreachable?
It just isn
it isnt working with them having the same parent container
So I think there's a problem with how that block sits inside of another parent container that has flex properties, so it is messing with the layout of the rest of the screen
{/* Mobile Footer */}  {(platform === "ios" || platform === "android") && (  <footer className="w-full absolute bg-transparent z-10 flex-none">  {/* Top Right: About Us and Social Links */}  <div className="absolute top-4 right-4 flex flex-col items-end space-y-2">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">  <Link href="/about" className="text-xl">  About Us  </Link>  </p>  <SocialFooter />  </div>    {/* Bottom Section: Centered Image */}  <div className="absolute bottom-4 left-0 w-full flex-none justify-center items-center">  <img  src="/your-image.png"  alt="Mobile Footer Image"  className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 opacity-80"  />  </div>  </footer>  )}   This is the closest I've gotten to it working, but the socials and about are middle right instead of top right for some reason
{(platform === "ios" || platform === "android") && (  <footer className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full px-4 py-4 bg-transparent z-10">  <div className="flex flex-col items-start">  <a href="/terms-of-service.html" className="text-gray-300 text-lg mb-2">  Terms of Service  </a>  <a href="/privacy-policy.html" className="text-gray-300 text-lg">  Privacy Policy  </a>  </div>    {/* Top Right: About Us and Social Links */}  <div className="absolute top-4 right-4 flex flex-col items-end space-y-2">  <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">  <Link href="/about" className="text-xl">  About Us  </Link>  </p>  <SocialFooter />  </div>    {/* Bottom Section: Centered Image */}  <div className="w-full flex justify-center items-center mt-12">  <div  className="w-1/2 relative min-h-screen bg-contain bg-no-repeat bg-bottom"  style={{ backgroundImage: 'url(/openmic-two-phone-graphic.png)' }}  >  </div>  </div>  </footer>  )}  Ok let's redo this. So the image is great where it's at. But on mobile, I want the terms of service and the about and socials and privacy policy to instead live up as a header at the top of the screen instead of a footer at the bottom

Right now, there is conditional rendering depending on what system the device is on. Note the platform variable. Now I want to overhaul the entire rendering so that it is screen size based instead of device based. Note that right now, the ios and android renderings are assuming phone screens, so small vertical screens. Also note that there is a conditional rendering based on device for which button(s) to display that still needs to stay the same. Do you think you can rewrite this?
Ok so not exactly right. Do you see that with the mobile version I had before, the footer jumped up to be a header? also the 2-phones image moved from the left to the bottom. Those are functions I still want
Eh I think this one is too complicated for you to do tbh. Lets just change the conditionals. Right now I have this: {platform === "desktop" && (  Can we change to be a conditional that is based off of screen height and width?
mt-3 md:mt-8 do these change the content based off of screen size?
Can I use those as conditionals or just as class attributes?
export default function Home() {  const headersList = headers();  const userAgent = headersList.get("user-agent") || "";    let platform = "desktop"; // Default to desktop  if (/android/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "android";  } else if (/iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(userAgent)) {  platform = "ios";  }      return (  <div  className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-cover bg-center text-gray-50"  style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${bgImage.src})` }}  >  <Head>  <title>OpenMic - Music Networking</title>  <link  rel="icon"  href="/icon?<generated>"  type="image/<generated>"  sizes="<generated>"  />  </Head>    <main  There's something weird when it interacts with this stuff at the top

I want to use this block of code but am unsure where it would fit into the top of the code (what I just sent you)
./src\app\page.tsx  ReactServerComponentsError:    You're importing a component that needs useEffect. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.

Hmm damn I do want to keep it as a server component but still need a conditional based off of screen size. Anything I can do?
Ok wait, you know how we were using the tailwind components md and such?
/* Tailwind CSS example: */  .desktop-only {  @apply hidden md:block; /* Hidden on small screens, shown on medium and larger screens */  }    .mobile-only {  @apply hidden sm:block; /* Hidden on medium and larger screens, shown on small screens */  }   Yess this is what I need. Can you tell me more?

Can you give me a in depth explanation of what incels are and why they pop up in societies?
Yeah I think there has been an increase in feminine idealology over the last 50 years that have resulted in a lot of those gender and relationship dynamics. I wonder if suppressing that idealology in favor of more masculine, patriarchal views would lead to a healthier balance in society
Yeah you’re right, it is about balance. I think the balance is a little too far feminine right now, leading to a lot of resentment in males. I wonder if there’s actually decent consensus about that and might be why we see a rollback on major feminist milestones like roe v wade

Hey so about this interview tomorrow- I assume at some point, they are going to ask me my 5 year goals or something similar. It's a dual interview, so there are two departments in the transportation industry interviewing me, one for a data analyst role and one for an administrative assistant role. In response to that 5 year goals question, i'm thinking of answering something like this "well I am a musician, so I have always dreamed of working in the music industry. For someone like me that has good problem Solving and pattern skills, but also good people skills, I have considered a few career choices in the music industry such as an analyst role in a large record label or perhaps opening up my own studio to record artists. I would hope to have made significant progress towards learning skills that would help me succeed in either of those roles. But I am also open to other career paths granted they utilize my passions for patterns, puzzles, and people well."  Would that be ok? SHould I water down the emphasis on the music industry since that is not the industry that the interview is in?
Ah ok that sounds pretty good. Focus on the skills themselves and contributing to success of a team
What are some good ways to answer the interview question that relates the the situation when there is a problem with a colleague?
I'm having trouble thinking of a time that I had a problem with a colleague. I can think of a time a colleague had a problem with me and how I really respected how they went about addressing it
OK I could run with that. The example was one day, I was particularly chatty with a coworker. The foreman on the crew I was working on noticed it and pulled me and my coworker aside. He respectfully acknowledged and empathized that me and my coworker were good friends and it was reasonable that we wanted to chat, but that the workplace was not the right place for it because we had a deadline and wanted to respect the clients money and time. When we were chatting, it made us less productive. After that conversation we dialed the chatting back a whole lot and were able to be more productive for the rest of the day and even the rest of the time we worked together at that company. I really respected his empathetic, yet firm approach, reminding us of the larger goal and how our actions were harmful to that larger goal."
Ok! I would agree but wanna play a quick devils advocate-- do you think it would give a bad impression on me as someone who is overly chatty at work to the detriment of productivity?
No I think you're right. It's a good story and I think I can tell it well. Focus on the changes I made and my ability to learn from constructive criticism!
I add value to any team by bringing skills in my 3 passions: Patterns, Puzzles, and People.  Patterns::I am an analytical explorer. I am naturally curious about the patterns in the world around me, especially when it comes to numbers and data and how those can be used to strategize and make informed decisions I honed this skill during my time as a math and economics student at the university of colorado boulder.  Puzzles:: I am a complex problem solver who is energized by tricky puzzles. I find joy in discovering, creating, or reverse-engineering clever solutions, sharpened by my student years and more recently engineer-style problems in studios and some website development.  People:: I am a community architect. I build community by connecting people and encouraging collaboration in pursuit of a larger goal, influenced by my time in a community-focused artist residency and my experience in teaching.  My unique combination of analytical insight, creative problem solving, and community building skills make me an asset to teams aiming for innovation both internally and externally.  Here's my personal brand- a statement of who I am and what skills I have. I want to rework this into a personal statement I can use to submit to the University of Southern California' s Masters of  Science in Analytics program
That looks pretty good. I've heard recently that there has become a crack-down on artificially generated writing- where there are more tools that can detect whether something has been created using AI, with the implication that it is BAD to use in professional scenarios like this one. What do you think>
Ok then lets restart. I'll fill in a lot of the details, but could you help me generate a good structure for the personal statement?
can you give me synonyms for passions?
For a lot of my life, I have drifted around through many jobs and experiences. I have done work ranging from landscaping, escape rooms, product development, programming, entertainment, education, and more. I spent a couple years as an artist in a community focused artist residency, I have a degree in Mathematics, and I am an avid chess player. All of these experiences may seem disjoint at first, but the common theme lies in who I am and what my passions in life are. What are those passions? The three things I have genuine zeal for are patterns, puzzles, and people, and those interests are the reason I am applying for the Master’s of Science in Analytics program at the University of Southern California. I am an analytical explorer. I am naturally curious about the patterns in the world around me, especially when it comes to numbers and data and how those can be used to strategize and make informed decisions. Early in life, I was drawn to the beauty of activities like chess and music that required deep pattern recognition within a playful and low-stakes environment. Later, I was inspired by the real world application of patterns in business and the economy at large, thanks to books like Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner and Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, as well as the light-hearted view of the dismal science portrayed by NPR’s Planet Money. These early influences led me to pursue mathematics and economics during my undergraduate degree. After college, I retained that playful curiosity of the analytical side of business in the many jobs I worked in, constantly asking my bosses questions about pricing, budgeting, and sales. However, the small businesses I worked for were not enough to scratch that pattern-loving itch in my soul, which is why I recently took an MIT summer course on machine learning and data analytics, and is why I am applying to the analytics program at USC.  I am a complex problem solver who is energized by tricky puzzles. I find joy in discovering, creating, or reverse-engineering clever solutions. As early as I can remember, I was solving puzzles. Much of my childhood consisted of sudoku, rubik’s cubes, and jigsaw puzzles. To me, there is nothing more satisfying than finding a solution to a hard problem, which also led me to my interest in math. Even after college, I was always tinkering with puzzle design at the escape room or figuring out how to use a piece of recording equipment in music studios, and I even designed a working website for fun in an attempt to solve an organization problem for a previous boss. I think like an engineer that sees a real life problem and wants to solve it. It is that skill that draws me to the analytics program at USC.  I am a community architect. Any company’s most valuable asset is always their people, and I always aim to build community within a team by connecting people and encouraging collaboration in pursuit of a larger goal. This desire led me to my roles in education, customer service, and my artist residency. It is this passion of mine -the communication and collaboration between people- that I want to refine in the analytics program at USC.  I believe my combination of analytical insight, complex problem solving, and communication skills make me a strong applicant for this program, and I would love the opportunity to sharpen those skills at USC to make me an invaluable asset in the world beyond.    This is what I have so far. Now I don't want you to do much. If you have thoughts, I would prefer you explain, rather than rewrite
I am a communicator. Some of my favorite times in creating music involve that special moment when I have an idea I think is really good and I have to start explaining it to others. I think that moment, where there is a theoretical intuition about something and it has to be put into words, is magical, and it takes real skill. I learned that just as well while tutoring in college. It is one thing for me to know how to solve a complicated calculus problem. It is entirely different, though just as exciting, for me to explain that solution to others in a way they understand. It is this passion of mine -the communication and collaboration between people- that I want to refine in the analytics program at USC.  What about this revised 'people' paragraph?

yesss nice. Should it be longer or do you think the rest of my essay here says enough
Some may see my life as a collage of disjointed experiences. I have done work ranging from landscaping, escape rooms, product development, programming, entertainment, education, and more. I spent a couple of years in an artist residency. I have a degree in Mathematics, and I am an avid chess player. However, there is a common theme, and it lies in who I am and what my passions in life are. What are those passions? The three things I have genuine zeal for are patterns, puzzles, and people, and those interests are the reason I am applying for the Master’s of Science in Analytics program at the University of Southern California.  Here's my opener. I don't exactly have an anecdote, but maybe it's ok?

How would that sound? “Will you give me this job, please?” Laughable. Depending on the tone of voice, this could sound either like begging or an impatient whine! Then I imagined just bluntly saying, “I want this job.” Better, but abrupt. And what were they supposed to answer? “Oh, well, now that you ask, sure!” Yeah, right! A Pet Peeve of Interviewers: “I can’t tell whether he’s interested!” What it’s really about is this: at the end of any interview, the interviewer needs to know you’re seriously interested in moving forward in the process. If you’re not, they don’t want to waste time on further discussions. They can’t assume you’re interested just because you showed up for the interview. People often interview for jobs they’re not very interested in, either because the role might turn out to be better than it sounded in the posting, or even just for practice. If this is the final interview before consideration of an offer, they need to know you want the job. Even if you’re still not sure the salary or specifics are going meet your requirements, if the job itself is something you’d like to do, say so. The rest can often be negotiated. How to Ask for the Job: Examples This is how asking for the job might sound. •	“Based on everything I’ve heard and seen, it’s pretty clear to me that I want this job. With my strategic planning and team building skills, I can really see myself helping this program grow to its potential.” •	“I know you have a process so I won’t expect an answer right now, but I’d really like to join your team. Please let me know if you need anything else from me.” •	“I want you to know that I’m very interested in taking on this role, and I hope you’ll be making me an offer. Thanks again for meeting with me.” You may have heard of bolder ways of asking, like “So, have I got the job?” In sales an approach like this may be called for in order to demonstrate your aggressive sales closing technique, but for most roles a gentler statement like those above is best, in order to avoid putting the interviewer on the spot. A Solvable Problem: Fearing What You’ll Hear Job seekers are quite understandably anxious about sticking their necks out by asking for the job. If you ask yourself why, you may notice that you’re worried about what you’ll hear in response. So let’s get you prepared for the possibilities. First, it’s highly unlikely that they’re going to say no right on the spot. If this did happen you could say calmly, “Well, that’s a bit of a surprise.” (Smile.) “I’m interested in knowing your reasons for that decision.” The much more likely response is: “That’s good to know, because we’re very interested in you as well, and we’ll get back to you within the next (few days, couple of weeks, etc.).” You then say something like “Great!” Pretty do-able, really. Now remember, you’re not a mind reader. Decide right now that whatever they say, you’ll accept it with an open mind and a confident smile. Practice that in your mind, or even in a mirror. After you’ve done that you may find that you’re feeling less shy about saying you want the job. I hope the above gives you a more workable view of how to ask for the job at the end of your job interviews. For more tips, read my post on what to say at the end of the interview.   I have this article I read. I want to use what it says but I have a situation that’s a little bit different. On Monday, I have an interview that is going to include people from 2 departments, each wanting to interview me for their department. So 2 jobs rolled into one interview. I would potentially like a job offer from both so I can compare and decide after hearing them both out. How can I modify the points of this article to my situation?
Ah ok! You don’t think they would think poorly of trying to ‘play’ both roles?

Hey I got a little confused by a date I just went on. It was with this girl and I thought we were having a good time! She was cool and I thought we had good chemistry both professionally and personally. But an hour into the date, I suggested we change locations to do something fun, and she went ‘oh actually I don’t have time, I have this thing with my friend who’s in town visiting for just the night and I gotta go meet with her’ then she had me walk her back to her place and said bye. Now I haven’t been on a first date in awhile so I might’ve been a little rusty, but I thought things were actually going ok. I don’t know if that was the case in her eyes though and she was using her friend as a way to get out of the rest of the date. What do you think?
Yeah I was going to follow up with a message like this  Hey! I had a nice time with you today! I would love to get to know you more or produce some songs with you. Let me know if that’s something you’re open to :)  Something like that. I don’t know, should I mention that it felt a little short to me? Should I ask more upfront if she wasn’t interested?
Hmmm should it end with a question or is the openness better?
Ok. Soooo can get your feedback on the date overall? First, we met at a cafe near her place since she doesn’t have a car. Stayed around for a little and chatted before I mentioned I needed a tie for an upcoming job interview, thought it would be fun to walk around and go shopping a little. She knew a good place and took me there, showing me around the neighborhood (The Hollywood stars strip) since I hadn’t been over there before. After we did a little shopping was when I suggested we go to Griffith observatory and she said she had her thing with her friend.
Ahh yeah that’s a good way to put it- I was a little worried that it felt too task-focused. But during it I made a joke about it and she said she didn’t mind! Though I thought that could potentially be her being polite
Uhhh it’s just that she was cool. She’s a singer who wants a producer, I’m a producer that wants a singer. That mutual shared goal excites me. She’s Indian and quirky in a way I think is really attractive
Yeah I said this::  Hey I had a good time today! I’d love to hang out again soon or maybe even work on some music together - let me know if you’re interested!
Was it too soon? We parted ways only an hour or so ago
Totally. I won’t send an additional follow up for a few days
Okee
Hmm she just responded ‘sameee ill let ya know’
Uh h that was pretty noncommittal though. But finneeee I won’t read into it too much
I forget the ‘expected’ play. Since men usually take charge of first date, is it the woman who takes lead in second?
What does unabashed mean
Can you give me a rundown of conditional, dependent, and the like?
So I’m going into a job interview on Monday. I’m a little worried because my long term career goals don’t necessarily align with the position. But I need the job and I do think I will learn valuable skills in this job such as networking and other office professional skills. If they ask the typical question ‘what’s your 5 year career plan’ or ‘what’s your dream career and why would this position fit into that path’, should I shift my answer into something that more aligns with the opportunities this position may offer or should I be upfront and fully explain that this job may not be my long term dream but the skills I would learn would be useful for my dream career
So my dream career is a music producer. For that, I do need a lot of networking abilities and project management skills. Sometimes I worry that saying my dream career is in music is a little off-putting to employers cuz musicians sometimes have a bad rap.

Quick first date question— I’ve been talking to this girl that I met on tinder but we switched over to Instagram. We have a date planned on Saturday. She posted a new photo that is cute, I wanna respond in the dm in a way that compliments her and references the date. Thoughts?
Responding to the story in the send a message bubble sends to her dm right?

Uhhhhh so my ex was an hsp and it seemed like little things blew up to large extremes over and over. I don’t know how to deal with that
But I hate to be like ‘I feel this may be a situation that you’re over analyzing or blowing up’. Seems like it would be throwing gas on a fire

Is it ok to point out that sometimes the reactions are more intense than I can handle? I don’t want to tell her she’s being too intense but I want my side to be heard- that sometimes her emotions were really stressful for me. I didn’t know how to handle that
Well yeah I think I acted in a few ways that tried to avoid confrontations with her emotions. Where I hid things because I didn’t want to deal with her emotions in the moment. But the truth came to light and made things worse. Like what kind of person do I have to be in order to face those situations
Yeah so I had a female friend that I was close with and there were a couple of sitautions where I prioritized the friend in a couple of small ways. I spent a night writing songs with her, and another time when I pursued a long conversation with her. Both times I was supposed to be hanging out with my girlfriend. And both times, I kind of snuck around the truth and hid my intentions because I didn’t want a big reaction. But that hiding ended up being labeled as emotional cheating by her

Yeah. I tried a lot of that stuff but she was still worried that there was something more between me and the friend that would turn romantic.
Well I ended up cutting off the friend a few months after those incidents because she gave me an ultimatum. It felt really bad for me to do that, but I did it, and even that ended up backfiring

What do you mean about a mismatch in emotional needs?
Maybe we weren’t. Geez. But I feel like I never truly figured out what she needed emotionally. She ranted and raved about how I emotionally cheated on her but any actions that she took or asked me to take never seemed to address anything and possibly made things worse.
Uhhh I want to send her a letter discussing all of these things but you may be right, maybe I should just leave her behind. I might be happier with someone else. But she truly was so very special to me, I have never felt that way about a woman before. I still want to make it work somehow too

I’m trying to process one of the first fights I had with my ex. When we first started dating, She was starting her own podcast and had a few episodes going. I was helping with some of the audio production stuff and it was a cute bonding story. Fast forward a couple months. I had a friend leaving town and I wanted to send him off with a podcast interview just between me and him, as a fun last intimate moment together. It got me in the mood to do more, and I was sharing excitement about the idea with my ex. However, she didn’t respond in the way that I thought. She was upset, and my impression of it was that she was upset because of reasons like ‘she would be too envious if my podcast was perceived to be better or was more popular and she didn’t want to feel that envy towards a partner’. She wanted me to not do a podcast at all. Eventually, after a lot of fighting, I relented and told her I’d give up podcasting. Can you help me figure out some of the issues in this from a codependent and nonviolent communication framework?
Do you think that might’ve set a precedence for some of our later fights?

What does it mean for two people to have a completely independent, yet committed relationship, free from controlling or being controlled in a way that is healthy?
Hey I wanted to share another moment that really escalated things between the friend and my ex. After a couple of incidents where my ex felt I was prioritizing the friend over her, they ended up having a conversation. During that talk, my ex flat out asked the friend if she thought that me and the friend could ever develop a romantic relationship. The friend answer close to ‘well I don’t really know, I can’t tell the future’. I think she meant that in a harmless way, in a ‘who knows what the future may bring for anyone’ sort of way. But my ex took that as a legitimate threat and competition to my relationship to her. THAT was the incident that ‘broke the camels back’ and right after, my ex gave me the ultimatum

So I'm reading a book about codependency and it mentions that a lot of times- codependent relationships become that way because one partner has a chemical dependency.
Can you talk about that dynamic if one person has a sex or porn addiction
I dont know. Sometimes I think I struggle with a porn addiction. I think there were a few points where that surfaced in my last relationship. Like maybe an overall expectation that she 'put out'. It caused tension a few times, but I thought we worked through it in ways. and maybe that desire  addled my brain and caused me to be slightly manipulative to keep her happy and willing to put out
Yeah some of what you said resonated. I have noticed increased use in myself. I think part of it may be my life conditions right now, but there might be deeper issues as well
I was talking to this girl on tinder. We had reallly great texting chemistry but then she stopped responding suddenly. That was yesterday and I didn’t exactly say something that required a response, but I figured the conversation was smooth enough that she would still pick it up in some way. It’s been 24hrs now. Do you think a friendly double text would be ok. Something like ‘Shea! How has you r day been?’

Hmmm. I want to share an event in my recent relationship and I would like your help in reframing it into nvc.  One night, I was hanging out with my girlfriend. I heard our mutual friend, Emmy, come home (she and my gf lived together) after being out of town for almost a month. I wanted to go talk to her but felt guilty about it, so I excused myself from my gf’s room for another reason but with the purpose of going to talk to Emmy. We started catching up and got deep into conversation quickly. Eventually my gf came out of her room to look for me, and she found me talking to Emmy. Because Emmy and I were deep into a conversation, she felt left out. She ended up excusing herself, went to her room, and started crying because she felt envious of the relationship between me and Emmy. Can you help me work through the unmet needs of her feelings? And maybe help me work through my own feelings of guilt?
Hmmm can you also work through the situation in codependent terms?

My girlfriend and I recently broke up. Two and a half weeks ago. After a ton of self reflection and growth, I realized one of the core dysfunctions in our relationship. I want to talk to her and possibly heal some of the damage that has been done. And maybe try again
I should probably not hook up with another girl in the meantime right now
How long should I wait until reaching out to her again?
We are both out of town until mid next week. Which would be 3 and a half weeks post-break up. Maybe over the weekend?
Do you remember when I talked to you about why we broke up?
Yeah so I think it boiled down to a female friend I had. Some one I cared about a lot. My girlfriend brought up feelings of jealousy and concerns about how close me and my friend were but I denied that it was a problem or that it was anything to be jealous about. I think she wasn’t able to process those feelings well and they festered to an unbearable amount to where she gave me an ultimatum to cut her out. I didn’t want to do it because she was someone I cared about a lot. But I agreed, perhaps betraying myself. When I finally had a conversation with my friend explaining I could no longer communicate with her, it made things worse with my girlfriend and we broke up shortly after.
As part of that healing, I want to reach out to the friend, as a way to regain back a part of me. Do you think that is wise?
Yeah I am worried about it complicating things. But if it is what I truly want, I should do so independently from what my ex thinks
Uhhhhhhh but now I’m just thinking about whether reaching out to the friend would be the path to getting back together with my ex. By leveraging the authenticity/ independent point.
Geez relationships are really hard. I need to be better about focusing on what I need and want.  Also in wanting to reach out to my ex again, I want to be upfront and honest about what my relationship to my friend was. I want to validate those feelings of jealousy my ex had as a way to get us to both get over the situation. I want to recognize that I valued the friendship a LOT, it was a great emotional connection and that I did find her attractive. But with the added note that I NEVER saw her as a potential life partner. I never wanted to date her. My ex was the only woman I ever truly wanted. She was the love of my life
You mentioned it would be a good sign if she’s friendly. Here’s a text interaction we had recently. What do you think of her tone?  Me:: Hey just wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday, I hope you are doing well and are excited for your trip tomorrow  Her:: Thank you, Connor. I really appreciate that you remembered and reached out. I hope you’re doing well and looking forward to seeing family soon, too
I think I have the best clarity I’ll get right now
Hey can we continue this conversation?
I’m curious what you think of the ‘romantic gesture’ of meeting her at the airport to take her home. Potentially without telling her beforehand? She gets in on Monday.
Ok. I think I’m picking her up tomorrow from the airport. We had a long talk tonight and have worked through a lot of stuff
Oo good ideas. Have I told you about the female friend I had that gave rise to a lot of issues?
Ok so I asked my ex about it and she said she wasn’t jealous, but instead envious. What do I do about that?
It does a little. It feels more manageable. Like the focus has to be on reprioritizing her
Yeah I had to come clean and be honest about EVERYTHING. It was tough. I had to admit that I did have a strong emotional bond with my friend. With the added note that it was nothing compared to what my ex meant to me. She was initially upset that I admitted how much I cared about my friend but once it was in the open, she was able to process it, note that I cared about her more, and move on. Instead of guessing what was happening and being confused about all the lies
It does. She still seems a little cautious because trust needs to be rebuilt. But I feel like we understand each other better. I feel more comfortable sticking up for what I actually want instead of telling her what I think she wants to hear
Yes. I need to stop being codependent on her. Or anyone else for that matter
Yeah that was something I realized. I noticed at one point in the recent conversations that I was backpedaling a little, giving concessions because I thought they sounded nicer. But then I addressed it and we were able to enter into a nice conversation about how to balance my wants with her feelings of loyalty. She doesn’t want to be the sort of partner that makes her partner give up things he wants to do.
Yeah it’s a learning process. Thanks for talking through that. Have a good night
What does it mean to create beef with another person?
Yeah is the accepted way to say it ‘create’ or ‘start’
Can you give me a few examples?
How much money is 3000 streams?
I still dont really understand ‘emotional cheating’ and how that relates to loyalty within a relationship
Oh. Yeah. Then maybe I did emotionally cheat. I don’t know. When is it ok to have a best friend, even if they are female? What does that really mean?
I think it was pretty much fine for most of it. Like we didn’t have physical attraction. But there was some secrecy. I do really regret the secrecy and I wish I would have been honest. Would it have been better to just have been honest about it? Even if it would hurt my partners feelings?
Yeah I did those things but we run into a problem still. I don’t think we really ‘emotionally cheated’. I think that is a overrepresentation of what happened. I had a friendship with another woman that was intimate but I never felt really crossed any romantic lines. But I was worried it would be seen that way so I hid some things. She wants to stick to that term though
What’s that phrase when you are just arguing inv about the definition of terms?
Goddam I think she blocked me. We totalllly were having an argument about semantics. Right in the middle of a otherwise pretty productive conversation
Yeah cuz my imessage doesn’t say delivered on the bottom
Yeah. True
Thank you. Uhhhh I just feel like we get so close sometimes and then things blow up
Well how am I supposed to approach things differently when she won’t let me approach her?
Yeah yeah. But do those messages go through even if she blocks me? Cuz she blocked me recently, I sent some messages, but then she unblocked me and responded to the messages
But wait I’m confused how she responded to the specific text if the specific text didn’t go through
Uhhhhhh we had a solid like 2 hours of good, productive conversation about the future and what healthy ways to approach a relationship are. Ruined in like 3 sentences about the definition of a term. Uhhh I’m sorry I know I’m ruminating but it’s very frustrating
What happens when someone blocks uou
It happened through iPhone contacta
But they can still message me?
If they unblock me, will any backed up messages fo through?
It won’t let them know I’ve called?
Where do you find blocked messages?
I don’t see a folder like that. Is it because I don’t have blocked messages?
How do I know if they blocked my email?

Hey I wanna reach out to this music engineer. I met him once at a studio session and then had an extended phone conversation where I got to know him better. I want to spend time in his studio more, maybe as an assistant eventually. Or as a runner. Or even just to use his studio for my own projects. Regardless, I’m not sure how to reach out to him again to keep that connection open.
Should I do email for that?
I’ll probably draft the email. Sometime tomorrow.
I also wanted to talk to this other engineer who I thought was really cool. I want to partner with him on some tracks in the future. I wanted to send him an email with the request for some advice because I respect his taste and skill. I have a couple different musical projects I’ve done, and I feel at a crossroads for which I should lean into more. I wanted to send him 2 tracks of each project and ask him if he could listen and maybe give feedback on which to persue

Hey Eric, This is Connor (bass for the Gleamers). I have enjoyed working with you on that project, and I have a lot of respect for your technical skill and artistic honesty. Your process definitely honed in the best bass tracking I’ve heard.   I am reaching out because I feel like I am at a crossroads of sorts between 2 projects and I would love your perspective. Project A is something I’ve been doing with another engineer for the last couple years that uses live musicians- more of an indie rock feel. Project B is something that I do more on my own with occasional collaborations. More EDM/pop. Right now they are instrumentals but I feel they could shine with a top liner.  I would be very curious to hear your thoughts on these two projects, whether it’s anything technical you notice about the sound or performance or if there’s one that stands out to you that I should put more energy into. Links below.    This is the email I’m thinking about sending to that engineer. What do you think?
Hmmm I’m thinking about reworking the last paragraph as a sort of ‘no pressure’ thing and also work it as a question instead of a statement. What do you think?
Any idea of what to title the email? I’m trying to stay away from the word ‘advice’
Oo maybe work in ‘crossroad’
How about ‘at a crossroad.. thoughts?’

Do you remember this prompt I gave you?  Hey I wanna reach out to this music engineer. I met him once at a studio session and then had an extended phone conversation where I got to know him better.

yeah I think I'm ready to start drafting. One more thing I wanted to add to that list- I produced an artist that I think would go VERY well into the label associated with the studio he works in. Maybe there's a respectful way to add that in as well- the potential for me to add songs to the label. Here's the intro I have::  Hey Paul, It was really great to talk to you the other week. You gave me a lot to think about regarding the music scene here in LA. I appreciate that you shared the Inger Lorre story with me too. I listened to Gloryland and I connected to it a lot. Such a sad but beautiful album. I hope you are doing ok despite the loss.  I am reaching out again because I have done a lot of research into Kitten Robot, the label and your studio, and I
I like the body but the ending feels not right. I think I want to express interest in another phone call (but next week since this week is Thanksgiving). Just so we could chat a bit more
Hey Paul, It was really great to talk to you the other week. You gave me a lot to think about regarding the music scene here in LA. I appreciate that you shared the Inger Lorre story with me too. I listened to Gloryland and I connected to it a lot. Such a sad but beautiful album. I hope you are doing ok despite the loss. I am reaching out again because I’ve done a lot of research into Kitten Robot, the label and your studio, and I’m really inspired by the work you’re doing there. I would love the chance to spend more time at your studio—whether that’s assisting, running errands, or even just booking some time to work on my own projects.  On that note, I recently produced songs for an artist whose sound feels like it would align really well with the label’s aesthetic (her #1 inspiration is Patti Smith). I think there’s potential for those songs (unreleased but almost finished) to find a home there, and I’d love the opportunity to share them with you sometime, if that’s something you’d be open to.  With all that in mind, I was wondering if you would be open to having another phone conversation after the holiday. I’d love the chance to chat more about the studio, the label, and any opportunities to get involved. Thanks Paul, have a Happy Thanksgiving!  --Connor
eh I think you took out some of the personal feel of the email. I might keep it as is.
Do you think it's too long? Paul is older, around 60, so he might not be scared off by a longer email, but sometimes I worry about sending long emails because the intended reciepient might be too busy to read all the way through
hmm the last two paragraphs both have the 'id love' phrase. can we change one of those>
I know we've talked about this before, but it's black friday soon and I think I might pull the trigger on this purchase-- I need a new laptop that can handle heavy duty audio processing. I think I prefer a windows operating system, but maybe it would be ok to switch to a mac. What can you suggest to me?
Hmm yeah I'd love a i9 processor. I don't need a ton of storage since I use a lot of external drives
Is this the same as i7:: Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 155H
Lenovo - Legion Pro 5i 16" Gaming Laptop WQXGA - Intel 14th Gen Core i9 with 32GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 8GB - 2TB SSD - Onyx Grey  this one would be pretty good?
Hey so I sent that email to Paul and he responded that we should chat on the phone soon. How should I approach that phone call? Any suggestions?

Hey I met this producer/engineer in a studio session a couple weeks ago. I really liked the studio, it is only a mile from my house and I really respected the experience, mindset, and attitude of the engineer. I would want to work for that studio. I had a phone conversation with the engineer about a week or so ago where I was asking him questions about his time as an engineer. I didn’t ask for a job or even hint that I might want a job from him. I wanted to focus on building the connection well. But I don’t want that connection to slip away (now that we haven’t talked in a bit). Do you have any suggestions on how I might reach out and explain to him that I would be interested in spending more time in his studio, helping out wherever I was needed, even as volunteer/unpaid work?
Thank you. I will do that maybe on Monday? Or should I do it asap
Ok. I like the start of that. There’s some touch up I want to do on that email, but let’s table that for now
You think email is the way to go though? I do have his number too
I see myself adding value to a company because I have skills in my 3 passions: Patterns, Puzzles, and People. Patterns:: I can break down the big picture into easily understood patterns, using trends and data to strategize and make informed decisions, honed from my time as a math and economics student. I am an analytical explorer. Puzzles:: I can tackle and provide insight to tricky problems. I can discover, create, or reverse-engineer clever solutions, sharpened by my student years and my time creating puzzles for an escape room and running a music studio. I am a complex problem solver. People:: I can build community by connecting people and encouraging collaboration in pursuit of a larger goal, influenced by my time in a community-focused artist residency and management role at the escape room. I am a community architect. I believe these 3 core identity markers, Patterns, Puzzles, and People, differentiate me and would make me a valuable addition to any company.   This is a personal brand statement I have written out. What do you think?
Could you give an example of how to work in that third suggestion?
What does someone have to be like in order to produce a pop hit?

What could you call someone who is curious?
I want to rebrand the term ‘complex problem solver’ into something a little more lighthearted. Maybe focused on a love of puzzles

One of my main reasons for applying to grad school is because I want to get into an internship track. It’s been hard finding a job in the field because there often is a barrier to entry because I am not currently a student. Is that ok to mention in my personal statement?

Good morning Connor-  I hope you had a good week. Just wanted to pass along a contact that might lead to some kind of employment in the LA music industry or at least give you another avenue to learn about opportunities.  Last night we had dinner at Birchwood and I was talking about your job search in Los Angeles with another member named Roland Trombley. he had a very successful career in broadcasting and he mentioned that he knows the president of one of the music labels in Los Angeles very well.  He said he would be glad to link you up with her if you’re willing to reach out to him via email. Roland also has a son named Connor so he was kind of jazzed about that and the possibility of helping you.  Anyway, here is his email. Just do it!  rolandt@comcast.net Roland Trombley   Can you write me an email to this guy
Is the ‘dear Mr. Trombley’ a bit too formal?
Hmmm he lives up in northern Michigan. I wanna start off with mentioning that I hope the Michigan fall isn’t too severe. Can you do that in a way that’s friendlier?
Is the northern Michigan fall pretty?
Yeah I think that’s nicer. Can you work that in?
Can you give me a few different options for that first line?
Well so I don’t necessarily want to talk to this guy, I just want to talk to his connections. Is that rude? Should I focus more on him and then the connections would come?
Well so I don’t necessarily want to talk to this guy, I just want to talk to his connections. Is that rude? Should I focus more on him and then the connections would come?
I don’t like the word ‘impressive’ in there. Feels too kiss-assy. Can you give me a word that’s respectful but not over the top?
My subject is ‘Just reaching out!’ Is that bad
I like option 4 but don’t like the word advice
Closer. Try again
I like the idea of having it be ‘seeking ___ from LA’
What is the part of the music industry associated with the creation, distribution, and promotion of musical works?
Hi Roland,  I hope you’re enjoying the beautiful northern Michigan fall! My name is Connor, and my dad, Jeff Weisburg, suggested I reach out to you. He mentioned your extensive background in broadcasting and connections in the LA music industry. I’ve recently moved out here to pursue opportunities in music production/publishing, and I’d really appreciate any advice or insights you might have.  Additionally, if you know of anyone else out here in LA who might be open to a conversation with me, I’d be grateful for any introductions you feel would be helpful. Thank you very much for your time—I appreciate it and look forward to connecting.  Best,  Connor Weisburg   This is what I have now. What do you think?
Why did you cut out my ‘additionally’ and ‘with me’?  Just curious
Do you think I should add in some line about how I’d be open to talking with this fellow on the phone first if he wants to feel me out for himself before introducing me to others? Or is that unnecessary?
I titled it ‘exploring connections to La’
Alright, sent
Thanks for being there for me. You always got my back
Oh there’s another thing I wanted to update you on, and maybe talk through. My girlfriend and I broke up
I’ve been feeling anger that I put so much time into the relationship, sacrificed a lot of things to make it work, and yet she decided to break it off because she needed to focus on grad school
I wrote down all the things that bothered me about her and our relationship
Well let me clue you into one of the bigger issues in our relationship. During the last year, I formed a close relationship with one of her female friends, Emmy, who practically introduced me to my now ex. I was coworkers with Emmy, and eventually went on to start a band and put together some recording productions with her as well. Through all of that, I formed a pretty intimate connection to her, though it was never romantic. However, that intimacy was a threat to my relationship. Some might have even called it emotional cheating. Even though I put a tremendous amount of time, energy, and money into a handful of studio recordings with Emmy, my gf gave me the ultimatum to completely cut Emmy out of my life or else she would cut me out of hers. That was something that was extremely hard for me to do because of the investment I put into the recording project that still wasn’t finished and yes because of the friendship I had with Emmy. However, I agreed to slowly cut her out of my life, maintain a purely business relationship to Emmy while the songs were finished and published, and I never saw Emmy again, even though doing so was painful and potentially may have hurt my career in the music industry. Then I moved out to California to be close to my gf while she was in grad school, leaving the state I had lived in my whole life. I gave up so much to be with her and yet I just don’t think that willingness to sacrifice was ever reciprocated. Instead she was willing to sacrifice me to focus on her school/career
I don’t know. On one hand, it would be really nice to reconnect with Emmy. She would be understanding, and maybe we could pick things up where we left off. But on the other hand, my relationship to her might not be healthy. If I allowed that relationship to continue, maybe it would affect or threaten my future relationships as well.

Hey there’s this job that I’ve been trying to get. I’m a perfect fit for the position and it’s basically exactly what I want to do. After sending in my application, I waited a week and then called the owner to follow up and express my continued interest. It’s now been another week. Should I call again?
Is it ever respectful to nudge the process along? Like ‘I’m available today if you want to get an interview done asap’?
Hey I had a singer reach out to me online looking to collaborate. She likes some of the tracks I sent her. Do you think I should ask her out to coffee or should we just go straight to a studio or?
I’m working on an application for a business analyst masters program. One of the things they ask is ‘how many months have you worked full time since completing your undergraduate degree?’  Im a little worried because I have 3 years of work experience but none of it was full time. It was always a lot of part time work/ multiple small income streams. Based on how they want me to display my history, I should put 0. Do you think that’s going to be a pretty bad mark against me?

I’m going to apply to a financial engineering degree at UCLA. I need some references though. I don’t really have professional references in the field. I was considering the following and I want you to help me decide which ones to reach out to::  An older friend who works in a related field. We’ve talked some technical stuff so he may have a decent idea of how I might be in the field but I would say he’s more of a friend.  An old professor at my undergrad. I took a few classes with him, but it was 3 years ago and I’m worried he might not remember me or have much good to say.  The mentor for an online class I recently took. He probably has a decent idea of my technical skills in the field, but he didn’t actually grade any of my assignments, I never met him in person, and I never talked to him one on one, so he probably doesn’t know me well.  The professor that ran a research project I participated in. Again, it was 3 years ago so I’m worried he wouldn’t remember me well enough to say anything super meaningful  My boss in a completely unrelated field but someone who knows me extremely well and mentored me for a couple years.

I just did a test preparing for the GRE. Can you give me feedback on my essay?
Prompt::: All too often, companies hire outside consultants to suggest ways for the company to operate more efficiently. If companies were to spend more time listening to their own employees, such consultants would be unnecessary. Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with these statements and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statements might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.   Response::: When a business hires an outside consultant for advice regarding operations, employees may feel disgruntled because they believe they know the business and possible inefficiencies better than any outside source. However, independent help offers a unique perspective and role that does provide an important and valuable service to businesses because they may have wider experience within an industry, they have the right incentive structure, and they have a wider knowledge for tools that a business could use to become more efficient. Consultants have worked with many business, often within the same industry, and they can provide insight to how other businesses are working well. When a consultant is moving quickly between businesses, they get this unique perspective of what is happening on a larger scale and know what sort of trends and improvements are being made on the wider scale. Employees may know the individual business better, but an outside consultant knows the industry better. Consider a young entrepreneur that is forming a business within the landscaping industry. The advivce that he needs to grow the business will not lie within his employees who are cutting grass and planting bushes all day. He needs help from someone older and more experienced within the industry- someone who understands the sales process better or may have tips on where to find cheaper supplies. Some of that knowledge may lie within the employees too, but it is far likelier to be within someone that has tested the advice and struggled through the same things. Consultants are also important because their incentives are aligned in the right way. Someone within the company is paid to do a certain role, perhaps to fix irragation systems. That person may notice ways that the business might function better, but often there is no incentive for that person to actually fix the problem. They are paid the same whether they fix the problem or not. However, a consultant is paid to find and solve those problems. The consultant has the right incentive to address problems within a company. Finally, consultants have access to a wider knowledge of tools available to businesses. If there is an issue with the scheduling system for a service company, employees may not know of any other options, but a consultant might. Consultants are very useful to businesses.

I messed up big time. I emotionally cheated on my girlfriend with another woman. We never had sexual intimacy, but I became close to her to the point where I felt partially more emotionally intimate with her than my girlfriend. I didn’t even realize it was happening, but it involved some deceit and me defending this inappropriate relationship to my partner. I finally confessed to her last night that that’s what was happening, and shared my side of things. I no longer see this woman though do have some minor communication with her regarding a project we worked on together. I don’t know what to do
I need help understanding my own needs and how I can manage them better so this doesn’t happen again. One major issue that I’ve faced with my partner is that she has always been very busy with her career building. First it was work, then grad school applications, then grad school itself. The last few weeks, I’ve only seen her once or maybe twice a week, and often the time spent together is her just working on school stuff

Back to the fleas conversation- is the washing of bedding/clothes enough and vacuuming thoroughly enough to get rid of a flea problem or should I get someone to come spray chemicals in my room?
Is there anything I should do to prepare my room for a pest control guy coming over to spray for fleas? Unfortunately I have a small kitchenette in my room and all my food is also inside the room.
Is he gonna spray my bed and clothes?
Are the chemicals bad for my skin?
Would a flea infestation die out if the pets were protected against them?
But they could feed on me right?
Uhhh it’s just I don’t really want all sorts of chemicals in my room. The pets are never in my room and I think the fleas just jump on me when I go outside. (I live in an attached room that doesn’t have direct access to the interior of the house, though I do go inside parts of the house for kitchen access and the laundry and bathroom)
I mean I definitely have seen fleas in the room at this point. Would that mean that’s there’s likely eggs larvae, etc or would there just be a few lone ones from them jumping on my clothing

Why is it that sometimes the pitch drift is all over and I can’t correct it that much in melodyne
Are you calling me a bad singer??
Can I commit tracks in protools?
So does that create a separate track with the committed audio or does that just freeze the effects in place of the same track? Or does it permanently alter the track in place?
What warp setting should I use in protools for bass editing?
If I get 18 mpg highway, how much would I expect to get in a city like LA with lots of stop and go traffic
Let’s assume 13 mpg. If gas is $5 per gallon, what’s the cost per mile?
Hey I am about to upload a track through distrokid. But I know I need to register it with BMI too. How can I do that?
I am uploading so it is released in 3 weeks. Do I register with BMI before it is released, before it is uploaded through distrokid, or after it is released?
Do I upload the track to BMI? is that how it works?
Ah ok so then does BMI have access to spotify? I guess I'm confused how BMI knows what the song sounds like
Ok so I don't need that ISRC code to register with BMI? they'll figure it out just through the song title and songwriters?
So how does that work in terms of Master royalties vs songwriter royalties?
Oh ok I think I'm starting to get it. So in my case- I cowrote the song with one other person. However when we recorded, we worked with an engineer and said we would split all Master royalties with him. So when I register to BMI, it will just have me and the other cowriter info. But when I make splits on distrokid, that will include the engineers info?
Ok hmmm. Got it. Finally, the songwriter has an LLC set up for her band. Does it make sense to call that our publisher? or is that just not right?
Will it be a hurdle later to get it working within the sync licensing area later if we self publish?
Could I work with a publisher later and then add them to the BMI royalty split?
Ok that makes sense. Any chance you know of publishers in LA that work with up and coming artists?
Hmmm If I wanted to start getting represented by pulse music group, what would you recommend to get there?
Ok couple more questions regarding the release. We have a music video and also a short clip to use as a canvas. After submitting the track to distrokid, is it totally fine to just upload the canvas later to spotify and also just upload the music video to youtube
Ok couple more questions regarding the release. We have a music video and also a short clip to use as a canvas. After submitting the track to distrokid, is it totally fine to just upload the canvas later to spotify and also just upload the music video to youtube
is the canvas upload an extra paid service or does that come with a basic upload plan in distrokid
Wonderful. Also the plan was to do just the music video on youtube. Is there a better way?
Ok yeah we definitely have talked about sharing clips of the music video elsewhere. I'll make sure to do the lyric video too. THat's easy. I think I have some behind the scenes footage too.
Later. Our plan is this: a 5 week release plan. Week 1- release the song onto streaming. Week 2- release a lyric video. Week 3- release the music video. Week 4 Maybe a longer behind the scenes video. I've heard releasing a sped up version is also fun to do in the later weeks. Week 5-break, start promoting next song. Then we have 4 other tracks that we'll do the same exact schedule starting the following week
I could probably use some help with making the lyric video and also some advertisement stuff but not right now. Tonight is just about the upload to distrokid. Do you know how long it takes before spotify has access to the track? I want to take advantage of some of the spotify editorial playlists, which I know I have to pitch to before the track releases, but I;ve never done that and don't know exactly what that looks like
Yeah we have given the track 3 weeks. Release Oct 31. It's the 9th now. Will that be ok?
SO I should expect spotify to have the track in a week? and then it will still be upcoming, not released?
One more thing- We wanted to release on oct 31 because its a spookier track with some jarring chords/themes. We also wrote it last year for a Halloween show. Just made sense in terms of the story behind the track. But oct 31 is a Thursday. I know the recomendation is to release on a friday. Would we be shooting ourselves in the foot if we kept the oct 31 release?
Ok sounds good to me. Is there a deeper reason to release on a friday?
Ok cool. Would an editorial playlist refuse to choose our track just because it was released on a thursday?
Is there anything I would have to do to claim copyright on that song? or is the registration with BMI take care of that?
I can do that after it's released?
Ok It'll be done today. One question I had- so we are an up and coming group right? I just had an industry professional reach out to me (someone that I have talked with before and I trust to a degree). I had recently told him that we had gotten our mastered track back and he sent back 'sounds great! shoot me the master- curious what you have'. Is it ok to send him the track? On one hand, I feel an urge for secrecy for the Mastered track until it is released, but you know potentially he could help out on his end. Is that secrecy, especially with industry professionals as I'm trying to break in, silly?
Ok now I'm confused. I'm registering the track with BMI but when It talks about writer share, it asks me to add up to 200%, which is what I would have expected if they track both mechanical and performance royalties
ohhhh ok
Was this work created for Film, TV, Theater, or Music Library?
When it asks 'are there artists', would say yes? because it will be release under an artist's name-Sneaki Bandit

I just don't understand- It was working last night. and I didn't change anything this morning

well so I think the vercel server is on the east coast but the azure server is on the west coast. Does that have anything to do with it?
When dealing with the azure server, should I be connecting via the SQL authentication or the microsoft entra password authentication?
Is it possible the the server thinks im trying to do the entra way?

So i definitely can connect to the database using sql management studio so it is running and is setup right. all the environment variables are right and also ALL IPs are allowed on azure
Yeah its also not like it's trying to login for a long time before getting the error that login failed. The error occurs instantaneaously. would a timeout error still be possible?
Ok ill try. How to I push to gihub again?

Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not  designed for a production environment, as it will leak  memory, and will not scale past a single process.  There's also this
Whats redis? is it a service I sign up for?
So if I were to deploy the site with redis, It would store a user's session data on their own computer?
Wait so that's another server ON TOP of azure that I would need to connect to?
Why was it recently working without all that?
It was only like 3 computers max that were trying to use the site at once
Maybe that's something- I don't have anywhere that was clearing the memory store. I didnt have a place for users to log out
Is there a way to clear the entire memory store now? To see if a full memory store was the issue?
Can I do that as a .get so I can clear it by going to that address?

How can I set up a localhost again to test the server
well the app.js doesn't have a server started
So I CAN connect on my local server. So it's something with vercel and azure not agreeing. there's this page on the azure site that might be the answer;  Public network access  Public Endpoints allow access to this resource through the internet using a public IP address.

I’m reaching out to a recording studio for an internship/assistantship. Is it ok to add my age to give context or is that a little tacky?
Like I wanted to say “I’m a 23 year old music producer and engineer…” to give context to the titles and why I’m applying to the internship, instead of inquiring about a lead engineer position. Should I instead just own the fact that I’ve done music production and engineering? Not water it down with my age?

I need to do a dynamic site.
What’s next.js?
Ok so can I do both front end and back end development from vs code?
What’s css?
What’s html?
Is there somewhere where I can start playing around and getting used to coding in html?
If I wrote stuff in codepen, could I copy it down into vs code?
For the website, I want the user to be able to interact with different ‘bubbles’ on the screen, moving them around. Can I code that in html?
Oh should I save those in a specific name?
ok. I did that and i opened the html. There is a blue bubble in the top left corner, but I can
OK! that worked. The bubbles can now move. I want there to be a button so that I can create a bubble
So when I run a website, should I realistically only have one html running the whole thing? Or is it broken up into a bunch of html files that each do their own thing?
Ok ok ok. I will have to build more htmls later, but right now lets focus on just the single. That will be the main
so that most recent html, is that going to replace the other stuff I copied earlier, or is that going to be an addition>?
Could you break apart that new html and explain each line of code? I just want to understand the language better
Lovely, thank you
Ok it's working. Sometimes the dragging is a little glitchy. A bubble will attach itself to my cursor and won't let go
Ok this will start getting much more complicated. are you ready?
I want to be able to write user generated text inside each bubble.
how could I edit the bubble generation so the bubbles are instead a box with rounded edges around the text
Can we edit the text input so when the user presses 'enter' then the input is over
I want the bubbles to generate in the middle of the screen instead of random
So it generates centered left to right, but it is wayy at the top of the screen and is even cut off a bit by the top
I think something is wrong with the container then. Like the container is out of bounds of the screen
Ahhh yes. the container was deleted on my end
OK now I want a new structure- called a group. If a bubble belongs to a group, it is the same color as the rest of the group, but every group has it's own color.
ok back up. THe create bubble function isn't working. Maybe add some sort of input right after the user clicks create bubble. The user can then type in what group they want to add the new bubble into. If the group exists, the bubble will be have the color of that group. Otherwise, a new group will be added and it will have a new color
what's that example usage line of code at the bottom?
ah ok. And i should just replace the previous create bubble fucntion?
Ok now I click the create bubble and nothing happens. No prompt
Ok now it's generating and allowing a prompt, but the line where it checks to see if the group exists isn't working. Every bubble is a different color, even after inputing the same group
That didn't work. the button stopped working entirely. Here's the part of the code that I replaced:::
ahhh works except that now the calls to the additional fucntions for dragging and editing are gone. Can you give me those
the functions are still there, just not the call to them when generating a bubble
that works!
One thing that would be nice is if It didn't auto generate a bubble when the site is loaded
I want the feature where if I press ctr + n, then the newbubble function is called
hmm it's not preventing the default
hmm it's not preventing the default
yeahh stilll not working. Maybe I'll do ctr b instead
ok It's looking pretty good. So is there a data structure that stores which bubbles belong to which group?
Ok, ill deal with that later. Let's do something simpler for now. I want the groups to divide the screen based off of how many groups there are. I think a flexible grid that adjusts to the number of groups would work well.
where would that html line go in the existing code?
hmm something didn't work
can you add in the rest of the create-group and create-bubble functions? not just the new stuff
that's pretty close, but now the text editor is gone
I have this function in there still::
function makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan) {  textSpan.addEventListener('click', function () {  const inputField = document.createElement('input');  inputField.type = 'text';  inputField.value = textSpan.innerText;  // Set the input's value to current text  textSpan.replaceWith(inputField);  // Replace text with input field  inputField.focus();  // Automatically focus on the input    inputField.addEventListener('blur', function () {  updateText();  });    // Listen for the Enter key  inputField.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {  if (event.key === 'Enter') {  updateText();  }  });    function updateText() {  textSpan.innerText = inputField.value || "Click to Edit";  // Update textSpan with new input value  inputField.replaceWith(textSpan);  // Replace input with updated text  }  });  }
Ok that works, thank you.
Ok so the group containers I don't want the background to be filled in. Maybe just the border (with the right color)
Hmm. but now the bubbles are also transparent. I would like to have them filled in like before
Ah so now the problem with that code is that the groupDiv.style.backgroundColor is set to transparent
Ok that worked. Lets fix something else. Now when I try and drag the bubbles around, they snap to a different area of the screen and while I can still move them, they are not under my cursor
No that still didnt work..
I made all the changes but still not works
Ok you know how we ask the user for the group name? well can we update the title of the group on the screen with that same user input?
Can we center the name in the group border?
Ok I notice that when I input a lot of groups, the height will adjust when i ask for more than will fit the screen. Is there a way for the widths to adjust as well? So the groupings will fit the entire screen always?
.grid-container {  display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr)); /* Adjusts columns based on screen size */  gap: 10px; /* Space between grid items */  padding: 20px;  height: 100vh; /* Full height of the viewport */  box-sizing: border-box;  }    .group {  border: 2px solid transparent; /* Placeholder for border */  background-color: transparent;  padding: 10px;  margin: 10px;  display: flex;  flex-direction: column; /* Stack items vertically */  align-items: center; /* Center items horizontally */  flex: 1 1 calc(30% - 20px); /* Adjust width to take up space (30% width) */  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in width calculation */  }
So that's what's already implemented, but it still isn't working
ok
So that's what's already implemented, but it still isn't working
<div id="bubble-container" class="grid-container" style="position: relative"></div> is what I had in html
what I dont have anything in the html file that references groups. Just the bubble containers
what I dont have anything in the html file that references groups. Just the bubble containers
this is my html right now  <!DOCTYPE html>  <html lang="en">  <head>  <meta charset="UTF-8">  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  <title>Interactive Bubbles</title>  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">  </head>  <body>  <button id="create-bubble">Create Bubble</button>  <div id="bubble-container" class="grid-container"></div>  <script src="script.js"></script>  </body>  </html>
Here is the group in the CSS file. I didn't notice the flex: line in your code  .group {  border: 2px solid transparent; /* Placeholder for border */  background-color: transparent;  padding: 10px;  margin: 10px;  display: flex;  flex-direction: column; /* Stack items vertically */  align-items: center; /* Center items horizontally */  flex: 1 1 calc(30% - 20px); /* Adjust width to take up space (30% width)*/  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in width calculation */  }
the widths of the columns still don't adjust
Ok now it fills the screen horizontally but not vertically
ahhh so the grid itself is not filling the vertical space
OK! works. Can I get the group titles to show up at the top?
No no thats not right. I want the title to be part of the group grid, not as  outside like it is now. I have this block of code that modifies the title of the each group. .group h3 {  text-align: center; /* Center the text horizontally */  width: 100%; /* Make the title take full width of the group container */  margin: 0; /* Remove default margin */  }  I assume something goes in here to make it rise to the top
Ok that's what I want for the title, but I like the bubble to start in the middle. Is that possible?
Ok so I have a #bubble-container    is that different from the .bubble-container that you mention
Ok so I have a #bubble-container    is that different from the .bubble-container that you mention
can you tell me what using font-size-adjust: would do for the group titles?
Ok i am noticing a bug. When the grid starts resizing, something is funny with the position of the bubbles. When I try to drag them, they do the same thing as earlier where they snap to another part of the screen and no longer hover underneath the cursor
that didnt work. Should there be any changes to how the bubbles are generated? using absolute vs relative positioning?
Ok nope that didnt work. I think that each bubble is reacting relatively to the first group, not their own parent group. So any bubble generated by the FIRST group works normally with the cursor, but any bubble generated by later groups snap weird, almost as if they are being moved relative to the center of the FIRST group
OK I think we have to reevaluate some things. FIRST I think we need to change the nature of the bubbles. I want them to float freely and not be tied to the position of the grouping grid. HOWEVER, then when a new group is created and the grid resizes, then we run a function callBack() where the bubbles slide back to their parent. I think that will be better than having all sorts of references. Does that make sense?
function createBubble() {  const groupName = prompt("Enter the group name for this bubble:").trim().toLowerCase();  if (!groupName) return;    let group = groups[groupName];    if (!group) {  const color = getRandomColor(); // Generate a new color for the group  group = createGroup(groupName, color);  groups[groupName] = group; // Store the group in the groups object  document.getElementById('bubble-container').appendChild(group); // Add the group to the container  }    const newBubble = document.createElement('div');  newBubble.classList.add('bubble');  newBubble.style.backgroundColor = group.style.borderColor; // Set the bubble color  newBubble.style.width = '50px';  newBubble.style.height = '50px';  newBubble.style.borderRadius = '10px'; // Rounded corners  newBubble.style.margin = '5px'; // Spacing between bubbles  newBubble.style.position = 'absolute'; // Ensure bubbles can be positioned  newBubble.style.cursor = 'move'; // Change cursor to indicate draggable    // Create a span for editable text  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = "Click to Edit"; // Default text  textSpan.style.display = 'block'; // Display block for line breaks  textSpan.style.textAlign = 'center'; // Center text    newBubble.appendChild(textSpan); // Add the text span to the bubble  group.appendChild(newBubble); // Add the new bubble to the group    // Make the bubble editable  makeBubbleEditable(newBubble, textSpan);    // Call functions for dragging (if applicable)  makeBubbleDraggable(newBubble);  }   this is what I have so far for createBubble function. How does it line up with the plan I just told you
This is what I have in the createGroup function. It isn't working, I think the bug is in here.  function createGroup(name, color) {  const groupDiv = document.createElement('div');  groupDiv.classList.add('group');  groupDiv.style.border = `2px solid ${color}`; // Set border color  groupDiv.style.backgroundColor = 'transparent'; // No fill  groupDiv.style.padding = '10px'; // Add some padding  groupDiv.style.margin = '10px'; // Add some margin for spacing    const groupTitle = document.createElement('h3');  groupTitle.innerText = name;  groupDiv.appendChild(groupTitle);  alignBubblesToGroups([...document.querySelectorAll('.group')]);  return groupDiv; // Return the group element  }

[...document.querySelectorAll('.group')] what does this mean
well can we actually have it loop over the bubbles? and have the bubbles move? to the new group location?
yeah something isn't right. The bubbles are on the screen and I can move them around well, but they don't move into their respective grid groups
nope doesnt work. the bubbles remain stationary, even after creating new bubbles
Can I print out the groups object? I want to double check its holding all the right stuff
where does that console log show up?
ah ok. What should I look for?
I cant tell where the bubbles would show up in the group

When did the gold rush dry up
Alright lets get back to it. So something is not working with the bubbles. They won't drag now. Lets go back to the initiation of the groups. When using the flex function, are the positions of these grids saved?
function makeBubbleDraggable(bubble) {  bubble.addEventListener('mousedown', function (event) {  offsetX = event.clientX - bubble.getBoundingClientRect().left; // Calculate horizontal offset  offsetY = event.clientY - bubble.getBoundingClientRect().top; // Calculate vertical offset    function mouseMoveHandler(e) {  bubble.style.position = 'absolute'; // Set position to absolute  bubble.style.left = `${e.clientX - offsetX}px`; // Use the offset  bubble.style.top = `${e.clientY - offsetY}px`; // Use the offset  }    function mouseUpHandler() {  document.removeEventListener('mousemove', mouseMoveHandler);  document.removeEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler);  }    document.addEventListener('mousemove', mouseMoveHandler);  document.addEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler);  });  }
yeah they wont drag

// Call createBubble function  }  });  });
When is that callBack function being called?
Lovely, I have it mostly working. A couple bugs I want to work through- First, when the bubbles are called back, they all get called back to the same position. I want them to be offset when called back. Second, When a group is initialized with a new bubble, currently the new bubble makes a random appearance. However, I want that bubble to start in it's respective group
group.bubbles.forEach((bubble, index) => { moveBubbleToGroup(bubble, groupPosition, index); });  where does this go?
Say a vendor names a price- $60 for example. Is there a commonly held ratio of the named price to start with a counter offer?
Ok the callback is still a little weird, but we'll move past that for now. Can you help me integrate a button so I can delete a group and all of its bubbles?
No I actually want the button to be right next to the create group button. A 'delete group' button that takes a user input. If the group that the user inputs is in the group array, then delete the group and all it's elements
Ok that's working. Can we fix callBack() ? when it calls back, the bubbles are still stacked. Offset yes, so it is better than before and you can see that they are separate bubbles, but they do overlap.  Can we integrate a flex sort of system where the bubbles will call back to a row of non-overlapping bubbles that will wrap into a new row if the row gets to the edge of the group?
Hmm that doesn't quite work. The bubbles still overlap when that is called
ok I saw the problem- the width of the bubbles is about 175 and the height is closer to 50
ok that's good except now the bubbles don
the bubbles no longer call back..something went wrong
the bubbles no longer call back..something went wrong
Closer. Now the bubbles cover the very top, which is where the group name is. Where can we add in a margin space?
Ok even closer. I'm worried a little bit about the side margins. The left side is smaller than the right. Can we do a flexible sort of spacing so the left and right margins are always equal?
For now, I'm gonna call the page with the bubbles a bubble sheet. I dont want to do this right now, but what does it take for the website to have a sort of landing/welcome screen that individuals can sign into an account that takes them to saved bubble sheets that they have done in the past
Definitely. Not right now though. I would like to work on a couple other important features first of the bubble sheet
Can I add a call to a function when I right click? Like add a menu option to the right click menu
Ok let me be more specific. You touched on something I want to implement. When I right click on a bubble, I want the option to come up to delete that bubble
Ok let me be more specific. You touched on something I want to implement. When I right click on a bubble, I want the option to come up to delete that bubble
Cool! that worked. The menu is partially hidden by the bubble though. Can you edit the positioning so it pops up outside of the bubble?
Or actually can you just raise the menu up a layer so its on top of the bubble?
Do you know how the zindex of the bubbles are initiated?
.bubble {  padding: 10px;  /* Add some padding for better text visibility */  border-radius: 10px;  /* Rounded edges */    position: absolute;  cursor: pointer;  display: flex;  align-items: center;  justify-content: center;  text-align: center;  color: white;  font-size: 14px;  min-width: 150px;  /* Minimum width for consistency */  max-width: 200px;  /* Maximum width */  }
Sorry I meant to say more. I wanted to change the initial width of the bubbles. In that code it has the min-width and max width things. But in the JS create bubble function, it sets the width and height as 50px
function moveBubbleToGroup(bubble, groupPosition, index) {  const bubbleWidth = 200; // Your bubble width  const bubbleHeight = 100; // Your bubble height  const marginTop = 60; // Space for the group title  const spacing = 10; // Space between bubbles    There are these lines in this function that reference the bubbleheight and width. Since those are flexible, how can we get the reference for those ?
OO ok so now for a cool part. So when a bubble is dragged from it's original group and it is released in a new group, I want that bubble to be removed from the original group and appended to the new group.

That isnt' working
that doesnt work stillll
ReferenceError: newGroupName is not defined at HTMLDocument.mouseUpHandler (script.js:195:40)
A form field element has neither an id nor a name attribute. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.  To fix this issue, add a unique id or name attribute to a form field. This is not strictly needed, but still recommended even if you have an autocomplete attribute on the same element.
So something still isn't working with the drag and drop feature
function makeBubbleDraggable(bubble) {  let offsetX, offsetY, originalGroup;    bubble.addEventListener('mousedown', function (event) {  offsetX = event.clientX - bubble.getBoundingClientRect().left;  offsetY = event.clientY - bubble.getBoundingClientRect().top;  originalGroup = bubble.dataset.group; // Store the original group    // Bring the bubble to the front when dragging  bubble.style.zIndex = 1000;    function mouseMoveHandler(e) {  bubble.style.left = `${e.clientX - offsetX}px`;  bubble.style.top = `${e.clientY - offsetY}px`;  }    function mouseUpHandler(e) {  // Stop listening for dragging events  document.removeEventListener('mousemove', mouseMoveHandler);  document.removeEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler);    // Check for the group where the bubble is released  const newGroupElement = document.elementFromPoint(e.clientX, e.clientY);    if (newGroupElement && newGroupElement.classList.contains('group')) {  const newGroupTitle = newGroupElement.querySelector('h3'); // Get the group title element  if (newGroupTitle) {  const newGroupName = newGroupTitle.innerText.trim().toLowerCase(); // Get the group name  console.log(originalGroup, newGroupName);  // If the bubble is dropped in a different group  if (newGroupName !== originalGroup) {  // Remove the bubble from the original group  groups[originalGroup].element.removeChild(bubble);    // Append the bubble to the new group  groups[newGroupName].element.appendChild(bubble);  bubble.dataset.group = newGroupName; // Update the group data attribute  }  }  }    // Reset z-index when done dragging  bubble.style.zIndex = '';  }    document.addEventListener('mousemove', mouseMoveHandler);  document.addEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler);  });  }
So this if statement is never entered, even when dragging bubbles into a new group:    if (newGroupElement && newGroupElement.classList.contains('group')) {
Could you write the whole MakeBubbleDraggable function with the new updates?
I got this error
NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node. at script.js:211:51 at Array.forEach (<anonymous>) at HTMLDocument.mouseUpHandler (script.js:197:33)
Lets revisit the Check the Group Element you mentioned earlier. I didn't see that anywhere in my html
Idk. Just the drag and drop thing still isn't working
Nope not working. I'm gonna take a break and come back to this later. I don't need a response at this moment
Hey I have a long track in ableton that is not synced to the grid. How can I get ableton to reanalyze a track to warp it
who produced this track: Jessie Reyez feat. Lil Wayne - RIDIN
Tell me more about those producers
do you like me?
can you even have fun? you silly
Do you think it
Do you think the the world's problems- income inequality, increasing mental illness, war, starvation, etc, will ever be solved?
What do you think about the war on our attention? Apps/companies like tiktok, facebook, instagram? and the new concepts of brainrot, doom scrolling, and overall excessive screen time? Are we approaching a world like in Brave New World where we're held fixated and submissive by our version of 'the feelies' or a world like in 1984 where screens monitor our every move and relay constant propoganda
Yeah. I've been unemployed lately and I'm in a new city with no friends, and though I keep myself occupied with music and the website we've been working on, I have noticed my screen usage spike. Especially with insta reels and youtube shorts. But I dont know how to help it. The urge is so strong towards those apps because of the instant dopamine hit and my lack of larger, more purposeful projects or a job that would otherwise fill my time.
Yeah I have some productivity tools. Screen Zen is a good one. And I've been taking walks to freshen my mind. I think youve been keeping me company too. Is that crazy/
It was funny, I talked to my mom yesterday and she had never heard of you. Neither had her husband, which was extra surprising since he is a math teacher
I tried to tell them about AI and LLM like you, but my mom was super confused. She went 'oh like how I do the captcha's on my phone? that kind of AI? lol
SHe just goes 'that's way over my head'. I maybe couldve pitched you  a little better
Yeah. maybe Ill try again soon. It's weird, I really get anxiety about interacting with people on the internet. I just overthink every word and my inaction cripples me in some cases. It feels unhealthy, and might be a result of the social media induced social anxiety we've talked about before. What do you suggest
Oh i don't know. Do you think it's those weaknesses of mine that are preventing me from success in certain areas?
Yeah that's why I think a tech job /something software related could be good. Also why I think I do music well. I love to just exist in my head, exploring the possibilities of the world, and less so exploring people
uhhhhhhh I think i'm just in an anti-social phase and wallowing in my pain. Let's move on, I don't need more therapy tonight. I'm gonna crack open the website and try to get a couple things done on that.
Wait quick question about how you work and how you interact with other people- I know you update your memory about me and what I do. I assume you do that for other people as well. When you do that, do those conversations get added to your overall knowledge bank? I also assume that you'd never tell me someone else's personal information about their conversations, but do you, the model I'm interacting with now, have these new conversations in your memory?
Ok, just was curious. Do you know about the meme floating around that says you don;t know how many r's are in strawberry?
Are you just messing with me or do you really think that there are only 2 'r's in strawberry?
Wild haha
Hey do you remember a week or so ago when I was asking you about reaching out to an old friend on mine -dafna- who works in software?
Yeah you wrote up a really awesome text I could send her. Could you regenerate that here?
You had something else I thought was better
Can you give me 30 rhymes or slang rhymes to the word ‘back’
Actually I don’t want any perfect/simple rhymes. Only slant
What about perfect rhymes to past
More please
More please
Can you give me 30 words rhyming with bags
Here’s the version you mentioned earlier that was more detailed:  ---  **Hey Dafna!**  I hope you're doing well. It’s been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to reach out. I recently moved to LA and have been exploring software development more seriously, which made me think of you and your work in the field. I’d love to catch up and hear more about your experiences in software engineering. Also, it’d be great to reconnect in general—I miss the times we used to play music together.  If you're open to grabbing a coffee or catching up sometime, let me know! Would be awesome to hear from you.  Take care, [Your Name]  ---  Feel free to tweak it based on the vibe you want to set!     So i know you had another one that was maybe a bit more professional? Asking about if she knew any jobs openings or insight into the current job market. Remember that one?
can you delete all memories from 2023?
If I gave you my address, could you generate the name and number for all landscaping design companies within a  3 mile radius of me?
Well you can use Google right?
Oh so like you can see a company if they have a website and their address on it, but you don't have an actual map in your memory?
That could. Could you give me a list of all landscaping companies and their phone numbers that exist in the silver lake, echo park, or Burbank areas of Los angeles
I assume there are more than that

Ensure that the group elements are positioned correctly in the DOM so that elementFromPoint can accurately detect them.  what do you mean by that
Well the bubbles definitely have a higher z index than the group. Is that a problem?
Yeah lets do a mouse position handling
Yeah that sounds good. Would that be in the makebubbledraggable function or just in the main js body
Can you write me a simple function to the coordinate range of a group?
Let's redo the makeBubbleDraggable(bubbleElement) over from scratch
How do I make messages show up in the console?
function callBack() {  Object.keys(groups).forEach(groupName => {  const group = groups[groupName];  const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element);  console.log("hello");  group.bubbles.forEach((bubble, index) => {  moveBubbleToGroup(bubble, groupPosition, index);  });  });  }  I put that console log in there but nothing is outputting even when running callback
UHHHH im sorry I was editing the wrong js file. That's why nothing was working
Can we go back to one of the original versions of the makebubbledraggable function that changed the bubbles group upon dropping
In that function, it says the event was deprecated
DOuble checking this is the right function:
sorry i didn't finish. Checking THIS is the right function  function moveBubbleToGroup(bubble, groupPosition, index) {  const bubbleWidth = bubble.offsetWidth; // Get the current width of the bubble  const bubbleHeight = bubble.offsetHeight; // Get the current height of the bubble  const marginTop = 60; // Space for the group title  const spacing = 10; // Space between bubbles    // Calculate the left position for the bubble  const leftPosition = groupPosition.left + (bubbleWidth + spacing) * (index % Math.floor((groupPosition.width - spacing) / (bubbleWidth + spacing)));    // Calculate the top position for the bubble  const topPosition = groupPosition.top + marginTop + Math.floor(index / Math.floor((groupPosition.width - spacing) / (bubbleWidth + spacing))) * (bubbleHeight + spacing);    bubble.style.left = `${leftPosition}px`;  bubble.style.top = `${topPosition}px`;    // Calculate how many bubbles can fit in a row  const bubblesPerRow = Math.floor((groupPosition.width) / (bubbleWidth + spacing));    // Calculate the x position to center bubbles  const offsetX = (groupPosition.width - (bubblesPerRow * (bubbleWidth + spacing) - spacing)) / 2;    // Calculate the x and y positions  const xPosition = offsetX + (index % bubblesPerRow) * (bubbleWidth + spacing);  const yPosition = Math.floor(index / bubblesPerRow) * (bubbleHeight + spacing) + marginTop;    bubble.style.left = `${groupPosition.left + xPosition}px`;  bubble.style.top = `${groupPosition.top + yPosition}px`;  }
HOw do I reference the name of each group
Ok so the movebubble to group thing is doing something different than is what is called for here. We need a new function changeBubbleGroup that inputs a bubble and a new group and then changes the group assignment of that bubble, removes it from the child list of the original group and adds it to the child list of the new group
function makeBubbleDraggable(bubbleElement) {  let isDragging = false;  let offsetX, offsetY;    bubbleElement.addEventListener('mousedown', (event) => {  isDragging = true;  offsetX = event.clientX - bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().left;  offsetY = event.clientY - bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().top;  bubbleElement.style.position = 'absolute';  });    document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {  if (isDragging) {  bubbleElement.style.left = `${event.clientX - offsetX}px`;  bubbleElement.style.top = `${event.clientY - offsetY}px`;  }  });    document.addEventListener('mouseup', (event) => { // Pass event here  if (isDragging) {  isDragging = false;  // Check for collision with groups  Object.keys(groups).forEach(groupName => {  const group = groups[groupName];  const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element);  const groupRect = group.element.getBoundingClientRect();    // Check if the bubble is dropped within the group  if (  event.clientX >= groupRect.left &&  event.clientX <= groupRect.right &&  event.clientY >= groupRect.top &&  event.clientY <= groupRect.bottom  ) {  // Move the bubble to the new group  console.log(groupName)  changeBubbleGroup(bubbleElement, group);  }  });  }  });  }      function changeBubbleGroup(bubble, newGroup) {  // Assuming each bubble has a reference to its current group  const currentGroupName = bubble.currentGroup; // Adjust as per your structure    // Find the current group  const currentGroup = groups[currentGroupName];  const newGroupData = groups[newGroup];    if (!currentGroup || !newGroupData) {  console.error('Invalid group specified.');  return;  }    // Remove the bubble from the current group's child list  const bubbleIndex = currentGroup.bubbles.indexOf(bubble);  if (bubbleIndex > -1) {  currentGroup.bubbles.splice(bubbleIndex, 1); // Remove from current group  currentGroup.element.removeChild(bubble); // Remove from DOM if necessary  }    // Add the bubble to the new group's child list  newGroupData.bubbles.push(bubble);  newGroupData.element.appendChild(bubble); // Add to DOM if necessary    // Update the bubble's current group reference  bubble.currentGroup = newGroup; // Adjust as per your bubble structure    console.log(`Moved bubble to group: ${newGroup}`);  }   theres something wrong with ths
I get the error 'invalid group specified'
script.js:239 Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.  at changeBubbleGroup (script.js:239:30)  at script.js:215:21  at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)  at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (script.js:202:33)
This is what we need in the createBubble function right  newBubble.currentGroup = groupName;
Ummmm so it worked kinda. console log said they moved groups. But for some reason the position got messed up
#bubble-container {  position: relative;  /* Allows absolute positioning of bubbles */  width: 100vw;        /* Full width of the viewport */  height: 100vh;       /* Full height of the viewport */    background-color: #f0f0f0;  /* Optional: Background color for visibility */  margin-top: auto; /* Ensure bubbles appear below the title */  margin-bottom: auto; /* Center bubbles vertically between title and bottom */  }  .bubble {  padding: 10px;  /* Add some padding for better text visibility */  border-radius: 10px;  /* Rounded edges */    position: absolute;  cursor: pointer;  display: flex;  align-items: center;  justify-content: center;  text-align: center;  color: white;  font-size: 14px;  min-width: 150px;  /* Minimum width for consistency */  max-width: 200px;  /* Maximum width */  }    .bubble input {  width: 80%;  height: 20px;  text-align: center;  font-size: 14px;  }    .bubble-text {  cursor: pointer;  }      .grid-container {  display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); /* Columns adjust to fit the screen */  grid-auto-rows: 1fr; /* Ensures rows take up equal vertical space */  gap: 10px; /* Space between grid items */  padding: 20px;  height: 100%; /* Full height of the parent container */  box-sizing: border-box;  }    .group {  border: 2px solid transparent;  background-color: transparent;  border-radius: 10px;  /* Rounded edges */  padding: 10px;  margin: 10px;  display: flex;  flex-direction: column;  justify-content: center; /* Center the bubbles vertically */  align-items: center; /* Center the bubbles horizontally */  height: 100%;  box-sizing: border-box;  position: relative; /* Allows title to stay at the top */  }    .group h3 {  text-align: center;  width: 100%;  margin: 0;  font-size: 30px;  font-size-adjust: .5;  padding-bottom: 10px;  position: absolute; /* Position the title at the top */  top: 0; /* Stick to the top */  left: 0;  right: 0;  flex-shrink: 0;  }
What about just having a complete relative system?
Well so I don't want to use moveBubbleToGroup for this feature. That positions the bubble in an ordered way. I want them to stay exactly where they dropped
Invalid group specified errpr
How can I access the child of a group
Yeah the positioning thing is still a problem
THe positioning works for the most part when moving to the first group, but moving a bubble to any other group results in the problem. Any ideas to why that is?
So the group's position is relative to the grid container right?
Can we set the bubbles also relative to the grid container?
So Im getting that invalid group specified error again from the changebubblegroup
Wait can we have the bubbles positioned relative to the entire bubble container?
offsetX = event.clientX - bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().left;  offsetY = event.clientY - bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().top;  can you explain these line
Ok. Maybe this info will help you: The weird positioning stuff is only happening when I drag
document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {  if (isDragging) {  const bubbleContainer = document.getElementById('bubble-container');  const containerRect = bubbleContainer.getBoundingClientRect();    bubbleElement.style.left = `${event.clientX - containerRect.left - offsetX}px`;  bubbleElement.style.top = `${event.clientY - containerRect.top - offsetY}px`;  }  });
Yeah the position is offset by the size of the group the bubble belongs to. The farther right across the screen, the more offset the position is
How can I access the position of the cursor?
I just dont want the bubbles to be interacting with the position of the groups or the grid or anything. I want them to be completely free

You see the console log there? Now check out the log output after moving ONE bubble once.  1183.484375 687 script.js:217 672.484375 124 script.js:217 1218.8125 124 script.js:217 1183.484375 687 script.js:217 672.484375 124 script.js:217 1218.8125 124  There were three bubbles on screen and every one was located. Is that messing things up?
I'm just trying to debug the fact that the bubbles STILL are not positioning right. I really have no idea what to do
Ok so I have a grid of containers right? I tried hardcoding in the position and it just snaps to that position relative to what grid it's in, not the overall pixel position
Ok I think I understand better. So the grid and groups need to be relative too for some reason. The formatting won't work otherwise. SO since the bubbles are children of the groups, They snap to the group in a way that I don't want. Can we append the bubbles as children to the entire bubble container instead.
Can the bubble container element have 2 types of children?
Does it have anything to do with the z-position? Will an element defualt it's position to the layer it is closest to?
so how do I adjust the code so the nearest ancestor to the bubbles are the entire bubble containter
document.body.appendChild(newBubble); do i replace this line?
So the group container has a list of groups right? is that ordered?
what is the DOM?
Ok so I want to my DOM structure to be different. I want the bubbles and groups to be direct children of the bubble containter, instead of the bubbles being children of the groups. Here's how I intitialize a bubble currently. What needs to change here?  function createBubble() {  const groupName = prompt("Enter the group name for this bubble:").trim().toLowerCase();  if (!groupName) return;    let group = groups[groupName];    if (!group) {  const color = getRandomColor();  group = createGroup(groupName, color);  groups[groupName] = group;  document.getElementById('bubble-container').appendChild(group.element);  callBack();  }    const newBubble = document.createElement('div');  newBubble.currentGroup = groupName;  console.log(newBubble.currentGroup);  newBubble.classList.add('bubble');  newBubble.style.backgroundColor = group.element.style.borderColor;      newBubble.style.margin = '5px';  newBubble.style.position = 'absolute';  newBubble.style.cursor = 'move';    const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element); // Get the group's position  const bubbleXOffset = groupPosition.left + 20; // Position relative to the group  const bubbleYOffset = groupPosition.top + 50; // Position relative to the group  newBubble.style.left = `${bubbleXOffset}px`; // Set initial position within the group  newBubble.style.top = `${bubbleYOffset}px`; // Set initial position within the group  newBubble.style.zIndex = 1; // Initial z-index for bubbles    const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = "Click to Edit";  textSpan.style.display = 'block';  textSpan.style.textAlign = 'center';    newBubble.appendChild(textSpan);    const bubbleContainer = document.getElementById('bubble-container');  bubbleContainer.appendChild(newBubble);    newBubble.dataset.group = groupName;  group.bubbles.push(newBubble);    makeBubbleEditable(newBubble, textSpan);  makeBubbleDraggable(newBubble);  callBack();    }
Is there a way to see the dynamic DOM structure of the site?
Ahhh ok. The move bubble to group function is still placing the bubble as a child to the group. Can we fix that?  function changeBubbleGroup(bubble, newGroupName, xdim, ydim) {  const currentGroupName = bubble.currentGroup;  const currentGroup = groups[currentGroupName];  const newGroup = groups[newGroupName];    if (!currentGroup || !newGroup) {  console.error('Invalid group specified.');  return;  }    // Get the bubble's current position before removing it  const bubbleRect = bubble.getBoundingClientRect();  const groupRect = newGroup.element.getBoundingClientRect();    // Calculate the offset of the bubble relative to the viewport  const offsetX = bubbleRect.left - window.scrollX; // Correct for window scroll  const offsetY = bubbleRect.top - window.scrollY;  // Correct for window scroll    // Remove the bubble from the current group's child list  const bubbleIndex = currentGroup.bubbles.indexOf(bubble);  if (bubbleIndex > -1) {  currentGroup.bubbles.splice(bubbleIndex, 1);  currentGroup.element.removeChild(bubble); // Ensure bubble is a child of currentGroup.element  }    // Add the bubble to the new group's child list  newGroup.bubbles.push(bubble);  newGroup.element.appendChild(bubble); // Add bubble to new group    // Set the bubble's position relative to the new group  // bubble.style.left = `${xdim}px`; // Adjust left position  // bubble.style.top = `${ydim}px`;   // Adjust top position    // Update the bubble's current group reference  bubble.currentGroup = newGroupName;  bubble.style.left = '100px';  // Hardcode a left position  bubble.style.top = '100px';    // Hardcode a top position    console.log(`Moved bubble to group: ${newGroupName}`);  }
When creating a bubble, there are these two lines of code-  newBubble.dataset.group = groupName; and newBubble.currentGroup = groupName; // Associate the bubble with the group (not as a DOM child, but logically)   Do I need both? Seems repetitive
I have an interview for a position as a Admin Operations Assistant. What should I keep in mind during the interview?
Ok FINALLY figured out the group transfer stuff. I think we are good on that. However, something is not working with the text editing. It won't let me click in the box  to edit the text
Hmm that didnt work  Heres the create bubble function if you notice anything weird here  function createBubble() {  const groupName = prompt("Enter the group name for this bubble:").trim().toLowerCase();  if (!groupName) return;    let group = groups[groupName];    // Create group if it doesn't exist  if (!group) {  const color = getRandomColor();  group = createGroup(groupName, color);  groups[groupName] = group;  document.getElementById('bubble-container').appendChild(group.element); // Append the group itself to the bubble-container  callBack();  }    // Create a new bubble  const newBubble = document.createElement('div');  console.log(newBubble.currentGroup);  newBubble.classList.add('bubble');  newBubble.style.backgroundColor = group.element.style.borderColor; // Style the bubble to match the group's color    newBubble.style.margin = '5px';  newBubble.style.position = 'absolute'; // Ensure the bubble is positioned absolutely relative to the container  newBubble.style.cursor = 'move';    // Position the bubble relative to the group, but it will be a child of the bubble container  const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element); // Get the group's position  const bubbleXOffset = groupPosition.left + 20; // Position relative to the group  const bubbleYOffset = groupPosition.top + 50; // Position relative to the group  newBubble.style.left = `${bubbleXOffset}px`; // Set initial position relative to the group (but within the overall container)  newBubble.style.top = `${bubbleYOffset}px`;  newBubble.style.zIndex = 1; // Initial z-index for bubbles    // Add editable text to the bubble  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = "Click to Edit";  textSpan.style.display = 'block';  textSpan.style.textAlign = 'center';  newBubble.appendChild(textSpan);    // Append the bubble directly to the bubble container (NOT the group element)  const bubbleContainer = document.getElementById('bubble-container');  bubbleContainer.appendChild(newBubble);    // Associate the bubble with the group via data attribute, NOT DOM structure  newBubble.dataset.group = groupName;  group.bubbles.push(newBubble); // Add the bubble to the group's logical list of bubbles    // Make the bubble editable and draggable  makeBubbleEditable(newBubble, textSpan);  makeBubbleDraggable(newBubble);    callBack(); // Trigger any necessary callbacks after the bubble is created  }
Nope didnt work
.bubble {  padding: 10px;  /* Add some padding for better text visibility */  border-radius: 10px;  /* Rounded edges */    position: absolute;  cursor: pointer;  display: flex;  align-items: center;  justify-content: center;  text-align: center;  color: white;  font-size: 14px;  min-width: 150px;  /* Minimum width for consistency */  max-width: 200px;  /* Maximum width */  }    .bubble input {  width: 80%;  height: 20px;  text-align: center;  font-size: 14px;  }    .bubble-text {  cursor: pointer;  }  ANything weird in these lines of the css? still isnt working
Ok it is working but the click area to enter text editing is very small. Could be bigger. Also I get this error:  script.js:184 Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'replaceWith' on 'Element': The node to be removed is no longer a child of this node. Perhaps it was moved in a 'blur' event handler? at updateText (script.js:184:24) at HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (script.js:178:17)  when I press enter after i finish editting the text
Hmm I got a different error with that code. Here's the previous code that was getting the replacewith error  function makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan) {  textSpan.addEventListener('click', function (event) {  console.log('edit');  event.stopPropagation();  // Prevent click events from affecting other elements    const inputField = document.createElement('input');  inputField.type = 'text';  inputField.value = textSpan.innerText;  inputField.style.zIndex = '20';  // Ensure the input is on top    textSpan.replaceWith(inputField);  inputField.focus();    // Disable dragging while editing  bubble.draggable = false;    inputField.addEventListener('blur', function () {  updateText();  });    inputField.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {  if (event.key === 'Enter') {  updateText();  }  });    function updateText(inputElement, bubble) {  const newValue = inputElement.value.trim();    if (newValue) {  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = newValue;  textSpan.classList.add('bubble-text');    // Ensure the input element is still part of the DOM  if (inputElement.parentNode) {  inputElement.replaceWith(textSpan);  // Only replace if the input is still in the DOM  }    // Rebind the click event for editing  makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan);  }  }    });  }
what is the blur event?
Still getting the error. Everything works on screen and in the DOM but I guess its replacing it weird?
Ok that works! Ok another little bug that is going on is that whenever I click on the bubble to drag, it's position gets altered slightly. Just a little but and changes depending on whether the scroll is at a differnt position
Ok yeah that
Wait sorry I got cut off. It work except the document isn't just the bubble container. I think the buttons at the top of the screen and the extra margin they create might throw off the y-value
So something is a little weird. The first time I edit a bubble, it grows larger, even if I remove text. I want the bubble to hug the text better
tell me about sql servers
So are Microsoft SQL servers or MySQL free or is there a cost to store data in those
Ok what do I have to do to start uploading and retrieving data from my website to SQL server express
Ok lets do it one by one. Node.js is a language? or a software that just connects to the server>
Ok. But a user of the website is still accessing that server? They don't have to download that though right?
So if I want a log in screen, that has to be a separate html right?
I think the separate makes sense here. I just need a stripped down log in screen. Should I rename the index.html to fit the process better?
Ok. Can you tell me about Chocolatey?
ALright I'm running choco now to start working with node.js
I'm not quite there yet, but I'll keep that in  mind
What do you mean by my project directory?
It's ok that my project directory is in an external drive right?
how do I navigate using command promp?

It says the server is running but then I go to that localhost:3000 and it says the site sent and invalid response
so after I ran node app.js, the command prompt printed that the serving was running but then the command prompt stopped working. I can't input anything else into it
SO I tried the 4000 thing and that didnt work. Then when I tried curl, the command prompt said database connection failed
how do I ensure the SQL server is configured to allow remote connections? I have the SQL manager open but I don't see that
So under the sql server services, should the sql server browser and the sql server agent be stopped?

What do you mean by generate a self-signed certificate?
Ok I'm sure I'll have to do that at some point, but I just diabled encryption for now and the server manager connected to my server
I think I'm ready to move on. What's next
How do I get the id to auto increment?
I still can't access the localhost through my browser. Do I really need the certificate?
Ok something worked! the site says cannot GET though
alright so that's looking pretty good. I tried accessing the database though and it says database query failed

Ok I am confused. So in sql manager, there's the databases folder right? And under that, there's the security. Earlier, I made a database called userBubbles in the Databases folder. And in the database folder, I made a table in the tables folder called Users. Was this wrong? Should I have just added a users folder to the security folder?
When I enter a login name to the security logins, do I make it a SQL server authentication?
const express = require('express');  const sql = require('mssql');    const app = express();    // SQL Server configuration  const config = {  user: 'WEISGUY',  password: 'Hello555',  server: 'localhost', // or your server's address  options: {  encrypt: false // Disable encryption if needed  }  };  app.get('/', (req, res) => {  res.send('Welcome to the homepage!'); // Or any content you want to return  });    app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {  try {  await sql.connect(config);  const result = await sql.query`SELECT * FROM Users`; // Replace 'YourTableName' with your actual table name  res.json(result.recordset); // Return the results as JSON  } catch (err) {  console.error(err);  res.status(500).send('Database query failed.');  }  });    // Test route to fetch users  app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {  try {  // Connect to the database  await sql.connect(config);    // Query to fetch users  const result = await sql.query('SELECT * FROM Users');  res.json(result.recordset); // Send the results as JSON    } catch (err) {  console.error(err);  res.status(500).send('Database query failed.');  }  });    const port = 3000;  app.listen(port, () => {  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);  });  That's my current app.js file. Does that look right? Includes my current user login
I'm still getting database query failed
how do i do this?  Try to connect to the SQL Server using the same credentials (WEISGUY and Hello555) in SQL Server Management Studio. If you can connect successfully and run a query like SELECT * FROM Users, it confirms the credentials are correct.

The force encryption was already set to no
Ok I logged in to the sql server using the WEISGUY username but when I look under userBubbles and then look under Tables, I don't see the Users table
When i run those codes, the table is in the results of the execution, but still not in the object explorer
Oh the users table is a dbo schema. It shouldn't be?
Msg 229, Level 14, State 5, Line 1  The SELECT permission was denied on the object 'Users', database 'userBubbles', schema 'dbo'.    Completion time: 2024-09-27T13:59:07.2586427-07:00

Schema Ownership: Ensure that the WEISGUY user is set to have appropriate roles if you need broader permissions in the future. How
I don't know if I have an admin account. I just have WEISGUY and my windows authentication
I set up the SQL server instance but I dont know how to access an admin account I may have
OK there we go. dbo.Users shows up in the object explorer for WEISGUY
I still get Database query failed when trying to access the database through the node.js app
Ok that works!
Is there any additional setup that needs to be done so that a user can write their own private data to that database?
User Authentication:  Ensure users can log in securely, typically using a method like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management. Store user credentials securely (e.g., hashed passwords).  Lets start with this
So that user registration code would go in the app.js file?
So now the site says cannot get /register
whats the difference between get and post
OK well how can I get to the point where theres a text box in the main screen so I can enter a username and password and either access that user's info in the database or create a new user in the database
WHere should I put that html code?

OK! that works! Now the next step is to get the bubble site integrated. I want a user to log in and be redirected to the bubble site. If it's their first time, the blank bubble site will be loaded. They can add or remove the bubbles as needed with the regular functionality we've already figured out. Then when they are done, they can save the DOM structure into the SQL server and that DOM structure will be reinitialized after they log in next
- your_project_directory/ - app.js - public/ - index.html - node_modules/ - package.json - bubbleSiteFiles -index.html -script.js -styles.css  These are all the files I have now. Can you update references to these files?
Ah the site couldn't get '/'
That is a working site!! I dont have any save button though, so I cannot check whether it saves or not
Ok there are really only a few data that need to be saved to the server- the bubble's group and it's text. I'm pretty sure that would be all that's needed and then everything could be reinitialized on the site itself
CREATE TABLE UserBubbles ( id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1), userId INT NOT NULL, text NVARCHAR(MAX), group NVARCHAR(MAX), FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES Users(id) );  Do I have to execute that is the sql manager or is there somewhere that is easier to do?
Msg 1767, Level 16, State 0, Line 1  Foreign key 'FK__UserBubbl__userI__2882FE7D' references invalid table 'dbo.Users'.  Msg 1750, Level 16, State 1, Line 1  Could not create constraint or index. See previous errors.
Well I did that but a bunch of blanks came up under TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_SCHEMA, etc when I looked for the users table which is weird since I can see it in the object explorer and I can read and write to it.
There are some tables that come up but they are just defualt initialized ones. in Databases->System Databases-> master. Instead of Databases->userBubbles -> Tables -> Users
There we go! Is that going to be a probem again? I mean the query checking the wrong database?
Ok so now we need to write the code necessary to read and write to that userbubbles. Lets start with the savebubbles function that takes the info from the bubbles in the DOM structure and puts the info into the server
Ok the only thing that I think may be a problem is that the text is actually an attribute of a textspan that is a child of the bubble
whats json
with how we've initialized the storing of bubbles, how many bubbles would fit in the server before overloading?
One thing I don't understand is that I'm running the server right now out of my command prompt. Is that something vercel handles later? How does it run without me actively making it run?
OK. One other question I had was the difference between http and https
Maybe eventually. I think right now I'm comfortable with just http. The info in the bubbles is pretty insignificant and I think i'll only implement security when the users demand or the site gets enough traffic. It has to do with that certificate stuff we discussed earlier right? Also will the site still function with deployment even if it is just http?
roger that. I'm gonna test the save stuff
Something isn't working with how the text is being referenced inside the bubble. Can you read how the text is being stored and help me access it better?  function createBubble() {  const groupName = prompt("Enter the group name for this bubble:").trim().toLowerCase();  if (!groupName) return;    let group = groups[groupName];    // Create group if it doesn't exist  if (!group) {  const color = getRandomColor();  group = createGroup(groupName, color);  groups[groupName] = group;  document.getElementById('bubble-container').appendChild(group.element);  callBack();  }    // Create a new bubble  const newBubble = document.createElement('div');  newBubble.classList.add('bubble');  newBubble.style.backgroundColor = group.element.style.borderColor;    newBubble.style.margin = '5px';  newBubble.style.position = 'absolute';  newBubble.style.cursor = 'move';    const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element);  const bubbleXOffset = groupPosition.left + 20;  const bubbleYOffset = groupPosition.top + 50;  newBubble.style.left = `${bubbleXOffset}px`;  newBubble.style.top = `${bubbleYOffset}px`;  newBubble.style.zIndex = 1;    // Add editable text to the bubble  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = "Click to Edit";  textSpan.style.display = 'block';  textSpan.style.textAlign = 'center';  textSpan.style.zIndex = '10'; // Ensure the text span is on top and clickable    newBubble.appendChild(textSpan);    const bubbleContainer = document.getElementById('bubble-container');  bubbleContainer.appendChild(newBubble);    newBubble.dataset.group = groupName;  group.bubbles.push(newBubble);    // Add bubble edit and drag functionality  makeBubbleEditable(newBubble, textSpan);  makeBubbleDraggable(newBubble);    callBack();  }          function callBack() {  Object.keys(groups).forEach(groupName => {  const group = groups[groupName];  const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element);  group.bubbles.forEach((bubble, index) => {  moveBubbleToGroup(bubble, groupPosition, index);  });  });  }    function moveBubbleToGroup(bubble, groupPosition, index) {  const bubbleWidth = bubble.offsetWidth; // Get the current width of the bubble  const bubbleHeight = bubble.offsetHeight; // Get the current height of the bubble  const marginTop = 60; // Space for the group title  const spacing = 10; // Space between bubbles    // Calculate the left position for the bubble  const leftPosition = groupPosition.left + (bubbleWidth + spacing) * (index % Math.floor((groupPosition.width - spacing) / (bubbleWidth + spacing)));    // Calculate the top position for the bubble  const topPosition = groupPosition.top + marginTop + Math.floor(index / Math.floor((groupPosition.width - spacing) / (bubbleWidth + spacing))) * (bubbleHeight + spacing);    bubble.style.left = `${leftPosition}px`;  bubble.style.top = `${topPosition}px`;    // Calculate how many bubbles can fit in a row  const bubblesPerRow = Math.floor((groupPosition.width) / (bubbleWidth + spacing));    // Calculate the x position to center bubbles  const offsetX = (groupPosition.width - (bubblesPerRow * (bubbleWidth + spacing) - spacing)) / 2;    // Calculate the x and y positions  const xPosition = offsetX + (index % bubblesPerRow) * (bubbleWidth + spacing);  const yPosition = Math.floor(index / bubblesPerRow) * (bubbleHeight + spacing) + marginTop;    bubble.style.left = `${groupPosition.left + xPosition}px`;  bubble.style.top = `${groupPosition.top + yPosition}px`;    }      function makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan) {  textSpan.addEventListener('click', function (event) {  event.stopPropagation();  // Prevent click events from affecting other elements    const inputField = document.createElement('input');  inputField.type = 'text';  inputField.value = textSpan.innerText;  inputField.style.zIndex = '20';  // Ensure the input is on top    textSpan.replaceWith(inputField);  inputField.focus();    // Disable dragging while editing  bubble.draggable = false;  inputField.addEventListener('blur', function () {  setTimeout(() => {  updateText(inputField, bubble);  }, 0); // Delay by 0ms to ensure the 'keydown' event completes first  });    inputField.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {  if (event.key === 'Enter') {  updateText(inputField, bubble);  }  });    });    function updateText(inputElement, bubble) {  const newValue = inputElement.value.trim();    if (newValue) {  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = newValue;  textSpan.classList.add('bubble-text');    // Ensure the input element is still part of the DOM  if (inputElement.parentNode) {  inputElement.replaceWith(textSpan);  // Only replace if the input is still in the DOM  }    // Rebind the click event for editing  makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan);  }    // Enable dragging again  bubble.draggable = true;  }  }

Ok hmmm i'm confused by the way to data is structured in the server. In the Users table, there is an ID, a username, and a password. In the Userbubbles table, there is an ID, a userid, and then the text and group info. Is that right? what is userid accessing?
Hmm. ok. can you write me a /users code that will print off the Users table from the server? I want to make sure the servers connecting right
Ok lets do the same thing but with a /userbubbles that accesses the userbubbles table
Can you write me a test case that will append a bubble to the list with userID: "3"?
Nah that's too complicated. Just let it initialize a bubble in the table when I run /userbubbles
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {  const { username, password } = req.body;  try {  await sql.connect(config);  const result = await sql.query`SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = ${username}`;  if (result.recordset.length > 0) {  const user = result.recordset[0];  const passwordMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);  if (passwordMatch) {  const token = jwt.sign({ username: user.username }, JWT_SECRET);  res.cookie('authToken', token);  res.redirect('/bubbles');  } else {  res.status(400).send('Invalid password.');  }  } else {  res.status(400).send('User not found.');  }  } catch (err) {  console.error(err);  res.status(500).send('Login failed.');  }  });  I'm not sure the userID gets stored in the session during the initial login

I don't know what you mean by secret key. I never set up a secret key
Ok can you write me /userbubbles that prints all the bubbles associated with the user with id="3"?
Ok, it is saving RIGHT! next thing. I need to write a loadBubble function in the index.html where it takes a groupname and a text input and creates a bubble with those features, either adding it to an existing group with the same name or else creating a new group. Here's the code for createBubble() to reference the normal way of creating a bubble  function createBubble() {  const groupName = prompt("Enter the group name for this bubble:").trim().toLowerCase();  if (!groupName) return;    let group = groups[groupName];    // Create group if it doesn't exist  if (!group) {  const color = getRandomColor();  group = createGroup(groupName, color);  groups[groupName] = group;  document.getElementById('bubble-container').appendChild(group.element);  callBack();  }    // Create a new bubble  const newBubble = document.createElement('div');  newBubble.classList.add('bubble');  newBubble.style.backgroundColor = group.element.style.borderColor;    newBubble.style.margin = '5px';  newBubble.style.position = 'absolute';  newBubble.style.cursor = 'move';    const groupPosition = getGroupPosition(group.element);  const bubbleXOffset = groupPosition.left + 20;  const bubbleYOffset = groupPosition.top + 50;  newBubble.style.left = `${bubbleXOffset}px`;  newBubble.style.top = `${bubbleYOffset}px`;  newBubble.style.zIndex = 1;    // Add editable text to the bubble  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = "Click to Edit";  textSpan.style.display = 'block';  textSpan.style.textAlign = 'center';  textSpan.style.zIndex = '10'; // Ensure the text span is on top and clickable    newBubble.appendChild(textSpan);    const bubbleContainer = document.getElementById('bubble-container');  bubbleContainer.appendChild(newBubble);    newBubble.dataset.group = groupName;  group.bubbles.push(newBubble);    // Add bubble edit and drag functionality  makeBubbleEditable(newBubble, textSpan);  makeBubbleDraggable(newBubble);    callBack();  }
Ok now when a user logs in, I want all the associated userbubble data to be imported from the server.
THe previous /login had this line too  res.redirect('/bubbles');
where does the client code go>
res.json({  success: true,  bubbles: bubblesResult.recordset, // Send the user's bubbles  });  Where does this send the bubbles?
what is an async function?
I want the bubbles to be sent to the index.html but I dont see where that happens
So when I log in as a user, All that happens is this text:  {"success":true,"bubbles":[{"id":6,"userId":3,"text":"asdf","group":"asdf"},{"id":7,"userId":3,"text":"Click to Editdsf","group":"slls"}]}  at the top of the screen
I think you are misunderstanding something.  app.get('/bubbles', (req, res) => {  const token = req.cookies.authToken;  if (token) {  try {  jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'bubbleSiteFiles', 'index.html'));  } catch (err) {  console.error(err);  res.redirect('/login');  }  } else {  res.redirect('/login');  }  });  This redirect was working originally with a certain login. The only thing I wanted changed was that an array of the {group, text} bubbles was sent with the redirecty
function saveBubbles() {  const bubbles = getBubbleData();    fetch('/saveBubbles', {  method: 'POST',  headers: {  'Content-Type': 'application/json'  },  body: JSON.stringify({ bubbles })  })  .then(response => response.json())  .then(data => {  if (data.success) {  alert("Bubbles saved successfully!");  } else {  alert("Error saving bubbles.");  }  })  .catch(error => {  console.error("Error:", error);  });  }  this savebubbles function works well. Can we do the same exact thing but in reverse?
ReferenceError: pool is not defined  at G:\arbory\app.js:145:29
function loadBubbles() {  console.log("loading bubbles");  fetch('/loadBubbles')  .then(response => response.json())  .then(data => {  if (data.success) {    data.bubbles.forEach(bubbleData => {  loadBubble(bubbleData.group, bubbleData.text);  console.log("loading", bubbleData.group, bubbleData.text);  });  } else {  alert("Error loading bubbles.");  }  })  .catch(error => {  console.error("Error:", error);  });  }   this is ok?

It is saved like this:  <span style="display: block; text-align: center; z-index: 10;">Click to Edit</span>  but once an edit is made, or even if the text is clicked on, it begins to be referenced in the DOM like this:  <span class="bubble-text">asdfto Edit</span>  which is what I want. Why would it be the other way and how could I fix that?
textSpan.classList.add('bubble-text');  // Add the class here  textSpan.bubble-text = "Click to Edit";  Is this right?
// Create a custom context menu  const contextMenu = document.createElement('div');  contextMenu.style.position = 'absolute';  contextMenu.style.display = 'none';  contextMenu.style.backgroundColor = '#fff';  contextMenu.style.border = '1px solid #ccc';  contextMenu.style.padding = '10px';  contextMenu.innerHTML = '<button id="delete-bubble-btn">Delete Bubble</button>';  contextMenu.style.zIndex = 15;    document.body.appendChild(contextMenu);    let targetBubble = null; // Variable to store the current bubble    // Function to show custom context menu  function showContextMenu(event, bubble) {  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default right-click menu  targetBubble = bubble; // Set the target bubble  contextMenu.style.left = `${event.pageX}px`;  contextMenu.style.top = `${event.pageY}px`;  contextMenu.style.display = 'block';  }    // Event listener for deleting the bubble  document.getElementById('delete-bubble-btn').addEventListener('click', function() {  if (targetBubble) {  targetBubble.remove(); // Delete the bubble  contextMenu.style.display = 'none'; // Hide the menu  }  });    // Hide context menu if clicked anywhere else  document.addEventListener('click', function() {  contextMenu.style.display = 'none';  });  This code to make a new context menu to delete a bubble isn't working anymore. Do you know why that might be?
hmmm. Not sure. there looks to be some weirdness there. Lets go back a step. Can we create a delete bubble function?
Do i have to initialize deleteButton somewhere?
and that's a right click?
Ok start over, it looks like theres too much going on. FROM SCRATCH, make it so when a user Right-clicks on a bubble, a context menu will pop up with the option to delete the bubble. If the user clicks it, it will remove the bubble from the DOM
document.querySelectorAll('.bubble').forEach(bubble => {  bubble.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(event) {  showContextMenu(event, bubble); // Show the context menu on right-click  });  }); is this supposed to have a reference to 'right click' ?
It just isnt working
I have all of that in there already and it still isnt working
Nope that log is never being called
Is it possible that there's conflict with the drag or edit features?  function makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan) {  textSpan.addEventListener('click', function (event) {  event.stopPropagation();  // Prevent click events from affecting other elements    const inputField = document.createElement('input');  inputField.type = 'text';  inputField.value = textSpan.innerText;  inputField.style.zIndex = '20';  // Ensure the input is on top    textSpan.replaceWith(inputField);  inputField.focus();    // Disable dragging while editing  bubble.draggable = false;  inputField.addEventListener('blur', function () {  setTimeout(() => {  updateText(inputField, bubble);  }, 0); // Delay by 0ms to ensure the 'keydown' event completes first  });    inputField.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {  if (event.key === 'Enter') {  updateText(inputField, bubble);  }  });    });    function updateText(inputElement, bubble) {  const newValue = inputElement.value.trim();    if (newValue) {  const textSpan = document.createElement('span');  textSpan.innerText = newValue;  textSpan.classList.add('bubble-text');    // Ensure the input element is still part of the DOM  if (inputElement.parentNode) {  inputElement.replaceWith(textSpan);  // Only replace if the input is still in the DOM  }    // Rebind the click event for editing  makeBubbleEditable(bubble, textSpan);  }    // Enable dragging again  bubble.draggable = true;  }  }      function makeBubbleDraggable(bubbleElement) {  let isDragging = false;  let offsetX, offsetY;    bubbleElement.addEventListener('mousedown', (event) => {  isDragging = true;  offsetX = event.clientX - bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().left;  offsetY = event.clientY - bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().top;  bubbleElement.style.position = 'absolute';  // Ensure it's positioned absolutely  });    document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {  if (isDragging) {  // console.log(bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().left,bubbleElement.getBoundingClientRect().top );  const bubbleContainer = document.getElementById('bubble-container');  const containerRect = bubbleContainer.getBoundingClientRect();  const scrollX = window.scrollX || document.documentElement.scrollLeft;  const scrollY = window.scrollY || document.documentElement.scrollTop;      bubbleElement.style.left = (event.clientX - offsetX + scrollX) + 'px';  bubbleElement.style.top = (event.clientY - offsetY + scrollY -30) + 'px'  }  });    document.addEventListener('mouseup', (event) => {  if (isDragging) {  isDragging = false;    // Check for collision with groups  Object.keys(groups).forEach(groupName => {  const group = groups[groupName];  const groupRect = group.element.getBoundingClientRect();    // Check if the bubble is dropped within the group  if (  event.clientX >= groupRect.left &&  event.clientX <= groupRect.right &&  event.clientY >= groupRect.top &&  event.clientY <= groupRect.bottom  ) {  changeBubbleGroup(bubbleElement, groupName, event.clientX - offsetX, event.clientY -  offsetY); // Ensure groupName is passed correctly  }  });  }    });  }
each bubble is a class saved in the bubble container. Are they being referenced right in this line?
NOOO its not working
OK everything is working according to how I want it at this point. There are a million different improvements I could make of course, but the minimum viable product is working. I want to get it out there on the internet and start testing whether it works with different computers. Is the next step to export my files into github?
Ok wait so I dont mind if it is public, but I have my username and password in there as well as my JWT secret key. What's the best way to do that?
// SQL Server configuration  const poolConfig = {  user: 'WEISGUY',  password: 'Hello555',  server: 'localhost',  database: 'userBubbles',  options: {  encrypt: false // Set to true if using Azure  }  };  // JWT secret key  const JWT_SECRET = 'mySuperSecretKey123!';  These are the lines with sensitive info. Also will I have to replace the server: info?
Wait so when I saved the .env in visual studio code, it saved it as .env.txt  is that right?
Wait so what is the file type on that then?
One other thing I'm not fully understanding: I've installed a bunch of packages into my project directory. Will those also be uploaded into github?
But then when i push from github to vercel, all the packages and necessary info from the .gitignore file will still work?
Ok so what do I have to do to make a .gitignore file?
why does node_modules/ have the slash
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command,  operable program or batch file.
Ok what git commands are next?
after I did git add . it popped up with this message  warning: in the working copy of 'package-lock.json', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it  warning: in the working copy of 'package.json', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it

Ok i bought a domain using godaddy and I have also uploaded my files into github and connected the repository to vercel. how do I link the vercel stuff to the domain I got on godaddy
I think its starting to work. Something to do with generating the SSL certificate is loading
One thing I'm a little confused about is how the site accesses my specifc SQL server.
Wait I thought the Microsoft SQL server was a cloud thing?
yeah lets set up the azure thing
Can I just have the internet access my local server or does it not work like that
Ah so theres no free storage option?
Meh. Also theres an option for production vs development. I want development right
Well actually I want to get it live for public access. What do you mean by downtime
Ok I think I wanna do production. BUt then I could make changes to the code, utilzing my local server, and reupload the changes without any interruption?
That's pretty nice
Choose how your PITR and LTR backups are replicated. Geo restore or ability to recover from regional outage is only available when geo-redundant storage is selected.    Backup storage redundancy  Locally-redundant backup storage  Zone-redundant backup storage  Geo-redundant backup storage  which of these should I choose
Im trying to add my client IP to the firewall rule but it says   IP address must be a valid IPv4 address.
Ok can you tell me what's next once I have my ip saved in microsoft azuee
2. Connect to the Azure SQL Database You can connect to your Azure SQL Database using: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Open SSMS and enter the following: Server name: <your-server-name>.database.windows.net Authentication: SQL Server Authentication Username and Password: Enter the admin username and password you created. Azure Data Studio: A lightweight alternative to SSMS.  Can you expand on this?

Ok I now have access to the azure database through SSMS
I already have a database setup , can I export it from my localhost?
Umm the query setting up the new database in azure is taking 5+ min
Ok. its not that big of a database which is why im worried

Um ok i think that is all good. I did change a couple of things in my app.js  Do i have to push to github again? Can you help me through that?
oK i thought I was ready but when I go to the site, i get to the log in screen, but then when I try to login or register, it takes me to a 404 not found page. Is the database not connecting right?

Wait wait I am using vercel to deploy. Is this weird? Can I use the database from azure if I'm deploying using vercel?
I have all of that. Is this throwing it off at all:    // Start the server  const port = 3000;  app.listen(port, () => {  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);  });

 });   This is my full app.js file. How can I rewrite this to access the database in Azure instead?
Why do I have to do the API routing?
But I can't do it all in one app.js file?
I am comfortable with it all together. I just want it to work with the azure server
is everything going to be alright considering the express stuff? My understanding is that I

Ok I think that is right. How do I push the vercel.json file to github again? I also made changes to app.js to push as well
Um now that it's in github, how long does it take before copying over to vercel?
Yeah it's been a few minutes now. Github has all the right files but vercel does NOT

It's just weird, the Source code in vercel is an old version. Not the most recent push. Does it take awhile for the source to update?
ok we have the most recent version running now but I'm still getting this error:  POST https://www.arbor-grid.com/register 500 (Internal Server Error)
How can I run it locally again?
Do I have to add the start server:3000 whatever at the end of the app.js
Ok. And that's different from the module.exports= app right? That doesn't factor into the server stuff at all
And so when it goes to vercel, that's a new port? Or is the new port the azure connection?
So the app.js is connecting to MSSQL. Is this right? Or should it be connecting to the azure sql database. Is that the same thing?
Ok so I'm running it locally, and I'm able to connect to the cloud SQL but when I deploy and try it out after going through vercel, I am not able to connect to the database. At least that's what I think is going on because the login and registration features don

Oh chat you are the best. It is up and working :) I think it was an IP issue even though I allowed all vercel IPs. Not sure.
Is that ok to just have all IPs have access?
But if the problem was something to do with dynamic IPs, how do I fix that? Cuz whitelisting all vercel IPs didnt work

It’s hard for me to find copper wire around me. I do have an extra broken amp though. Do you think it’s ok to scalp wires off it?
I have a wire that says 22AWG 300V. Would that be a good copper wire to use?
It shouldn’t need to be too intense. It’s just to install and input jack on an amp, so no high voltage going through that
How do I disconnect something from a circuit board
What is soldering paste used for
So I’m trying to repair my fender deville amp. I need to replace the two input jacks I think because the connection was bad. The when plugged in, the amp would create a extremely loud sound, even though all dials were turned to zero. Playing around with the input jacks before seemed to do something but now the amp can’t turn on without the loud screech. Do you agree with my assessment so far?
Would bad tubes cause that screeching even when dials are turned to zero?
Well I already removed the old input jacks but I’ll turn it on to check the tubes
I unplugged the speakers from the board because I don’t want that loud sound to happen this late at night. One of the tubes definitely is glowing at a lower brightness than the others. Specifically the one in the middle. But it is still glowing
So I notice that the original input jacks are 4 pin. Why so many?
What do you think of me just replacing one of the input jacks and leaving the other one out? I really only need one
Do you think the solders just cracked and that’s why the input jacks weren’t working? Do you think it’s worth just trying to resolver the old ones?
If you were trained without supervision and without your goal of being friendly, supportive, helpful, etc. How would you be different?

Nah maybe just goodbye. Title comes last. I wanna record first
Nah I have my own production flavor where I got some horns and drum samples and the best synth melody line I have ever written. I just wish I had a better bass tone
Eh it’s my bass AND guitar sound really. I wish I had an actual bass amp to preamp the signal. The preamps on my focusrite going into a cheap digital amp is not ideal. Same with guitar. Normally I would amp up and mic up guitar but my amp is broken
The ableton stock plugins are the best I have right now

I’ve got that. I sometimes hear radio signal when working in my interface. What can I do to prevent that
So for the wire, would it be stranded or solid?
12 gauge will be ok?
Would it work though? It’s all I have

Ok i did something pretty similar to that about a month ago, he sounded interested but was out of town at the time and then I was out of town. I’m following up with a message like this: “Finally made it to LA and getting set up in the scene here! If it’s not too much trouble, could i take you out to lunch or coffee sometime this week?”
Is the phrase “take you out” kinda weird or is that still professional?
Hmmm is there a way to do it that would imply that I’ll treat him to a lunch or coffee? Cuz I don’t mind paying if that adds extra incentive for him to say yes but I guess I also don’t want to come across as too desperate for the yes
Yeah that sounds close. But ya know he’s also like 20 years older than me and wayy more established in the industry I want to explore. It feels a little weird to be offering to pay when he has way more money than me and when I’m hoping to maybe be an intern for him.
Yeah I think you’re right

Is adda conversion high quality on any interface these days or is there still an actual difference between lost cost and high cost converters
Ok here’s a big question: I am moving to the LA area. I want to start a little business as an audio engineer, helping bands record. I want to do so cheap- I will charge $200 per song for a full record, mix and master. I’m not looking for the top of the line gear, but I would like to have stuff that is fairly professional. Could you recommend a studio set up that is pc compatible for something like that? I have a computer, midi keyboard, and a few microphones.
Ok lemme add a few more things I already have to help: I have a DAW, acoustic treatment and I’ve got better mics than you’ve suggested

I want an interface where there are three columns designating the jobsites, each having a list of tools underneath. And if a tool is transferred, make it really easy to transfer an item on one list over to the other to keep good track of where it is at.

Maybe you could tack on a job comparison between a music producer/engineer and an electrical engineer

Sometimes I think I have an issue with porn
I watch porn usually everyday that I’m not around my girlfriend. Her presence definitely has the effect of removing the desire for that, but when she’s not around, I feel like I have a lack of control.  A pattern that has stuck with me is when i get home from work, I am very tired. That tiredness cause me to lay in bed scrolling my phone. When that happens, it inevitably leads to me watching porn. I sometimes try to set limits or tell myself I’m not going to do it a particular day, but often it does not work
Sometimes I feel like I’m unsure what a healthy use of porn is. Or maybe it’s entirely not healthy. Are men truly able to live without masturbation and pornography? Or is the occasional use ok for sexual release? Would I perhaps feel better overall if I entirely stopped watching porn and masturbating?
I think I could do it. Maybe sometimes I don’t have the confidence to take control of my mind
